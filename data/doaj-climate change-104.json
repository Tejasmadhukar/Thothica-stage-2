    "abstract": "The development of information technology such as the continuous improvement of mobile Internet infrastructure and the performance of computers has made it easy to process and share information. The huge market demand for location-based information services provides huge impetus to the generation and development of mobile terminal positioning technology. Generally speaking, the main causes of climate change can be summarized into two categories: natural climate fluctuations and the impact of human activities which is a major measure taken by China to actively respond to climate change. This is a successful approach to actively explore the rapid development of China’s industrialization and urbanization, which not only develops the economy and improves people’s livelihood but also responds to climate change and reduces carbon intensity. Firstly, this paper mainly is aimed at the connotation of regional low-carbon economic development mode, studying the basic mode of regional low-carbon economic development, and analyzing the characteristics and applicable conditions of each mode. Secondly, based on the machine learning algorithm of data mining, the main mode selection of regional low-carbon economic development is discussed. Thirdly and finally, when choosing the regional low-carbon economic development mode, comprehensive consideration should be given to the economic development basis, energy structure, resource characteristics, industrial status, development mode, geographic location, and other factors. This paper studies the basic conditions and applicable conditions of regional economic development models. The conclusion shows that from the perspective of regional economic evolution, low-carbon economy can be regarded as the decarbonization process of economic development. It is an economic form combining its own characteristics and an inevitable requirement for the transformation of regional economy from other economic models to low-carbon economic models. And other factors of Selection of regional economic development foundation, energy structure, resource characteristics, industrial status, development mode, geographical location, were also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The substantial climate change mitigation potential of restoring peatlands through rewetting and intensifying agriculture to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is largely recognized. The green deal in Denmark aims at restoring 100 000 ha of peatlands by 2030. This area corresponds to more than half of the Danish peatland, with an expected reduction in GHG emissions of almost half of the entire land use, land use change and forestry (LULUFC) emissions. Recent advances established the functional relationship between hydrological regimes, i.e., water table depth (WTD), and CO2 and CH4 emissions. This builds the basis for science-based tools to evaluate and prioritize peatland restoration projects. With this article, we lay the foundation of such a development by developing a high-resolution WTD map for Danish peatlands. Further, we define WTD response functions (CO2 and CH4) fitted to Danish flux data to derive a national GHG emission estimate for peat soils. We estimate the annual GHG emissions to be 2.6 Mt CO2-eq, which is around 15 % lower than previous estimates. Lastly, we investigate alternative restoration scenarios and identify substantial differences in the GHG reduction potential depending on the prioritization of fields in the rewetting strategy. If wet fields are prioritized, which is not unlikely in a context of a voluntary bottom-up approach, the GHG reduction potential is just 30 % for the first 10 000 ha with respect to a scenario that prioritizes drained fields. This underpins the importance of the proposed framework linking WTD and GHG emissions to guide a spatially differentiated peatland restoration. The choice of model type used to fit the CO2 WTD response function, the applied global warming potentials and uncertainties related to the WTD map are investigated by means of a scenario analysis, which suggests that the estimated GHG emissions and the reduction potential are associated with coefficients of variation of 13 % and 22 %, respectively.",

The intensive development of technology and the improvement of industrial production processes have led to a significant increase in technogenic impact both on increasing catastrophic natural disasters and on the global climate change formation. The adoption of the World Environmental Constitution by all the states would be an effective means of regulating and minimizing these negative processes. Timber harvesting is one of the most dangerous types of technogenic impact on the forest environment, as the forest stand, young growth, natural watercourses and soil are damaged during logging and transportation. However, the degree of the negative impact of timber harvesting can be reduced to an ecologically acceptable level, and technical indicators of the use of timber-hauling machinery can be brought to economically feasible values by properly assessing the intensity of the environmental risk of taking a decision on certain technical and technological issues and the implementation of environmental management of this process. The article presents some approaches to the creation of GIS spatial planning model of transport development of forest-exploitation area based on the cost estimation of timber skidding considering technogenic impact of forest machines. The development of the model of forest transportation planning is a complex task. In order to solve this task, the system under investigation should be divided into separate interconnected modules, each acting as its own model: the models for forest transportation planning, the database, formulation of the task, the results of modeling, an analysis of transport movement possibilities, an analysis of environmental damage, the assessment and improvement of the existing forest road network. Concerning the proposed model and methodology that is based on the analysis of potential environmental risks associated with the rutting and cost-assessment of timber skidding, we have obtained the model map of environmentally-acceptable types of timber-hauling machines for a real forest exploitation area, the Rozhanka forest district, the Slavsk State Forestry Enterprise in particular. The proposed model makes it possible to substantiate environmentally safe and economically feasible ways of skidding, estimate the ratio of transport development of a forest area using various terrestrial technical means (wheeled and crawler tractors or cable systems), as well as to outline the possible occurrence, intensity and spread of environmental hazards associated with timber harvesting.",

Low-and middle-income countries bear the brunt of the health impacts of climate change and migration, despite their overall low contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. The CIHLMU Symposium 2021 aimed to explore the complex interconnections between climate change, migration and health from diverse global perspectives. A number of themes, such as the relationship between climate and trade, the role of technology, and the issue of responsibility were tackled. The speakers also highlighted the need for climate resilient health-systems, gender mainstreaming in climate strategies, collaboration between the Global North and South and urgently defining the ‘climate refugee’. It is crucial that the narrative around climate change moves from an environmental framing to encompass human health and migration within climate discussions and strategies.",

    "abstract": "Museum collections are critical to contemporary biological research, but museum acquisitions have declined in recent decades, hampering researchers' ability to use collections to assess species responses to habitat modification, urbanization, and global climate change. Citizen science may be a key method to bolster museum collections data, particularly from urban regions, where ongoing data collection is critical to our understanding of ecosystem dynamics in a highly modified and variable landscape. In this study, we compare data collected as part of the citizen-science project Reptiles and Amphibians of Southern California (RASCals), hosted on the platform iNaturalist (www.inaturalist.org), to data in the VertNet database (www.vertnet.org), which houses millions of museum collection records from over 250 natural-history collections, for four focal species, including a native lizard of conservation concern that has declined with urbanization, a native lizard that is widespread in urban areas, and two invasive aquatic species. We compared numbers of VertNet records over time to modern RASCals records, and the number of records collected from urban, suburban, and protected areas from both databases. For all species, citizen-science records were generated much more rapidly than museum records. For three of our four focal species, RASCals participants over 27 months documented from 70 to 750% more records than were added to the VertNet database after 1990. For the urban-tolerant southern alligator lizard, RASCals participants collected nearly 45 times more modern urban records than are contained in the VertNet database. For all other species, the majority of RASCals records were collected within suburban or other highly modified landscapes, demonstrating the value of citizen science for collecting data within urban and suburban ecosystems. As new museum acquisitions decline, citizen-science projects like RASCals may become critical to the maintenance of modern species-distribution data.",

Many trade-offs will need to be weighed up for the future sustainable management of marine ecosystems between renewables and other uses (e.g., fisheries, marine protected areas). Therefore, we need a much greater understanding of how different marine habitats and ecosystems are likely to change with both natural and anthropogenic transformations. This work will present a review of predictive Bayesian approaches from ecosystem level, through to fine scale mechanistic understanding of foraging success by individual species, to identify consistent physical (e.g., bottom temperature) and biological (e.g., chlorophyll-a) indicators of habitat and ecosystem change over the last 30 years within the North Sea. These combined approaches illuminate the feasibility of integrating knowledge across scales to be able to address the spatio-temporal variability of biophysical indicators to ultimately strengthen predictions of population changes at ecosystem scales across broadly different habitat types. Such knowledge will provide an effective baseline for more strategic and integrated approaches to both monitoring studies and assessing anthropogenic impacts to be used within marine spatial planning considerations.",

    "abstract": "Despite their sparse vegetation, dryland regions exert a huge influence over global biogeochemical cycles because they cover more than 40% of the world surface (Schimel 2010 Science 327 418–9). It is thought that drylands dominate the inter-annual variability (IAV) and long-term trend in the global carbon (C) cycle (Poulter et al 2014 Nature 509 600–3, Ahlstrom et al 2015 Science 348 895–9, Zhang et al 2018 Glob. Change Biol . 24 3954–68). Projections of the global land C sink therefore rely on accurate representation of dryland C cycle processes; however, the dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) used in future projections have rarely been evaluated against dryland C flux data. Here, we carried out an evaluation of 14 DGVMs (TRENDY v7) against net ecosystem exchange (NEE) data from 12 dryland flux sites in the southwestern US encompassing a range of ecosystem types (forests, shrub- and grasslands). We find that all the models underestimate both mean annual C uptake/release as well as the magnitude of NEE IAV, suggesting that improvements in representing dryland regions may improve global C cycle projections. Across all models, the sensitivity and timing of ecosystem C uptake to plant available moisture was at fault. Spring biases in gross primary production (GPP) dominate the underestimate of mean annual NEE, whereas models’ lack of GPP response to water availability in both spring and summer monsoon are responsible for inability to capture NEE IAV. Errors in GPP moisture sensitivity at high elevation forested sites were more prominent during the spring, while errors at the low elevation shrub and grass-dominated sites were more important during the monsoon. We propose a range of hypotheses for why model GPP does not respond sufficiently to changing water availability that can serve as a guide for future dryland DGVM developments. Our analysis suggests that improvements in modeling C cycle processes across more than a quarter of the Earth’s land surface could be achieved by addressing the moisture sensitivity of dryland C uptake.",

This natural medicine resource is at risk of being exhausted due to the double interference of climate change and anthropogenic over-collection. Little is known about habitat characteristics and the crucial environmental factors that influence the levels of active ingredients. The goal of this study is to understand the variability in the bioactive compound content of a wide range of wild S. mussotii as it adapts to changing environmental conditions. The target compound content of the whole plant material was analyzed with the environmental explanatory variables of the field sample sites using a constrained ordination method for their correlation analysis. The results show that 16.3 percent of the sampled wild S. mussotii populations with the highest bioactive content can be grouped into the elite type. The most prominent environmental variables affecting the content of major bioactive products include altitude, aspect, soil TK content, Fe content, and C/N and N/P ratios. Altitude and aspect put indirect effects that are mediated by plant height and density, N/P ratio puts a direct effect, while soil TK content, Fe content and C/N ratio have both direct and indirect effects on the bioactivity of S. mussotii. In addition to the total negative effects of altitude and C/N ratio, the remaining factors play a driving role. These findings demonstrate variation by geographical conditions across S. mussotii accessions for physiologic responses and secondary compounds in wild populations. The knowledge gained from this study can be used for environmental and plant physiology research, efficient collection of naturally active compounds, and conservation strategies for rare natural plant resources.",

Out of the 1779 islands making up the 23 countries, 674 of them hosted at least one species from the above categories. 84 of the 150 species are endemic to this study area and many of these occur on islands with high susceptibility to climate change, with many of them occurring on one island only. The species data, together with islands, was overlain with Mean Significant Wave Height (Hs) projections for 2081–2100 under RCP4.5 and 8.5, and further analysed for threat of extinction. A large number of critically endangered and endangered species fall in regions that have the highest Hs projections.",
