    "abstract": "Svalbard archipelago is experiencing the effects of climate changes (i.e., glaciers' thickness reduction and glacier front retreat), but how ice melting affects water biogeochemistry is still unknown. Microbial communities often act as environmental sentinels, modulating their distribution and activity in response to environmental variability. To assess microbial response to climate warming, within the ARctic: present Climatic change and pAst extreme events (ARCA) project, a survey was carried out along a transect in Konsfjorden from off-shore stations towards the Kronebreen glacier. Total bacterial abundance and the fraction of actively respiring cells (labelled by cyanotetrazolium chloride, CTC), cultivable heterotrophic bacterial abundance, and extracellular enzymatic activities (leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), beta-glucosidase (GLU), and alkaline phosphatase (AP)) were measured. In addition, water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total suspended matter (TSM), particulate and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and inorganic compounds were determined, in order to evaluate whether variations in microbial abundance and metabolism were related with changes in environmental variables. Colder waters at surface (3.5–5 m) depths and increased turbidity, TSM, and inorganic compounds found at some hydrological stations close to the glacier were signals of ice melting. CDOM absorption slope values (275–295 nm) varied from 0.0077 to 0.0109 nm−1, and total bacterial cell count and cultivable heterotrophic bacterial abundance were in the order of 106 cells/mL and 103 colony forming units/mL, respectively. Enzymatic rates P a, Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) and Particulate Organic Nitrogen (PON) (0.97, 0.780, 0.734, P < 0.01), suggesting that fresh material from ice melting stimulated the metabolism of the cultivable fraction.",

    "abstract": "The Altai Mountain is located at the intersection of cold and arid regions. Climate change and overgrazing directly affect the growth of the grassland ecosystem in this region. This study took the grassland community in the Burqin forest area of the Altai Mountains as an example to analyze the species diversity and productivity of different grassland types based on 50 sampling plots. The relationship between species diversity and the productivity of grassland types at different altitudes was also discussed. The results showed that: (1) In the Burqin forest area, the desert steppe was dominated by Gramineae, Compositae, and Leguminosae. Montane steppe and mountain meadows were dominated by Umbelliferae, Gramineae, and Liliaceae. Gramineae, Ranunculaceae, and Liliaceae were the dominant families in both montane meadows steppe and alpine steppe but occurred in varying proportions. (2) The variation in plant numbers at the family–species level was characterized as montane steppe > alpine meadow > montane meadow steppe > desert steppe > mountain meadows. (3) The similarity in species composition among communities of different grassland types was low. In DS and MM, the number of grasslands and species played a decisive role in determining the biomass. The biomass of MS and AM was determined using the Simpson and Shannon–Wiener indices, and the number of dominant species determined the biomass. The number of grasslands and species did not have a significant impact on the biomass of MMS, which may be due to human factors such as grazing. (4) The dominant species in the grassland at an altitude of 1200–1400 m is prominent. The number of individuals in the dominant species was large and evenly distributed. Margalef peaked at an altitude of 1600–1800 m, but the number of individuals was small, resulting in low biomass and diversity in this range. Most plants survive at an altitude of 2000–2200 m; therefore, in grassland protection and planning management, it is important to consider the specific situation of plant growth under different habitats at different altitudes and make reasonable protection decisions based on local conditions to maintain species diversity and sustainable development of grassland ecosystems. This study provides basic data to support the theoretical basis for the protection and sustainable utilization of grassland resources and the restoration of degraded grasslands in the study region.",

The most frequent method to solve the problem is to decrease heat losses in buildings by increasing the thermal resistance of enclosures. The most popular measure to improve windows is the use of low-emissivity coatings and inert gases. The U-value of such glazing unit is mostly dependent on the possibility of coating to reflect IR (infrared) radiation. These coatings are very effective when surface temperatures are high. During service of windows with a change of outdoor conditions (mostly temperature and wind), an U-value of it will suffer changes. The aim of this article is to show an influence of outdoor temperature on thermal performance of windows with a low-emissivity glazing and to determine the differences of declared and design U-values of modern effective windows substantial enough to introduce a concept of a normative design U-value for windows in Lithuania. We have found that differences between declared and design values (under the conditions of Lithuania) reach on average up to 17% for double glazed IG units with one low-E coating. Thus in case of very effective windows, it makes sense to introduce a concept of design U-value for windows in our country. First Published Online: 26 Jul 2012",

    "abstract": "Wetlands are an important transitional ecosystem, and they play an important role in maintaining ecological balance. However, human activities and climate change have led to a decrease in wetlands. Therefore, to explore the degree of damage and assess the future trends of Guangxi wetlands, this study used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, and the support vector machine algorithm was selected for comparison and analysis to simulate the accuracy of land cover. GIS was used to analyse the evolution and degree of damage of nearly 30 Guangxi wetlands. The geographic detector model was used to explore the driving mechanism, and finally, the CA-Markov model and multi-scenario simulation were used to predict the wetland evolution from 2018 to 2035 to reveal the future direction of development. The results showed that (1) From 1990 to 2018, paddy fields accounted for the largest proportion of wetlands in Guangxi. In the past 30 years, the total area of wetlands in Guangxi has been degraded, with a total decrease of 983.33 km2. (2) The degree of wetland damage results showed that the total damaged area was greater than the total restored area, The wetland damage in Nanning city was the most serious, with an area difference of 503.22 km2 between the damaged and restored areas. (3) The analysis of the driving mechanism of wetland damage showed that distance from cities and towns, average precipitation and population density were the main driving factors. (4) The spatial distribution of natural development and economic construction in 2035 will be slightly damaged; additionally, the spatial distribution of ecological protection will expand as a whole. From 2025 to 2035, wetlands will be basically stable under Natural Development Scenario (NDS), degraded each year under the Economic Construction Scenario (ECS), and steadily increased each year under Ecological Protection Scenario (EPS).",

    "abstract": "Water table management through controlled tile drainage and subsurface irrigation (CDSI), retrofitting to conventional tile drainage, has been developed to abate the environmental impacts of irrigation and drainage meanwhile supporting agroecosystems and crop productivity. Since the environmental profile of new technologies is a prerequisite to understanding their socio-economic benefits, a life cycle assessment was conducted to assess the environmental impacts of CDSI on corn production for the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons at St-Emmanuel, south-western Quebec in eastern Canada, compared to the free drainage (FD). Inventory flows of corn production with CDSI and FD were developed using biophysical data from field experiments and public databases. Then, environmental impacts were compared for corn production with CDSI and FD, including climate change, eutrophication potential, acidification potential, and toxicity. The assessment results show the environmental benefits of implementing CDSI, particularly in improving water quality. However, potential synergy and trade-offs of climate change, eutrophication, and acidification impacts from the implementation of CDSI, especially under different climatic conditions, should be further monitored to improve the performance of the technology. Nevertheless, CDSI and associated practices can be adopted as adaptation measures in agricultural water management to support agroecosystems and address the challenges posed by environmental impacts. HIGHLIGHTS This study compares environmental impacts of controlled drainage with sub-irrigation (CDSI) and free drainage (FD) for corn agroecosystems in eastern Canada.; GHG fluxes data from the field were integrated into the life cycle inventory.; CDSI has positive impacts in reducing environmental impacts of corn production on climate change and eutrophication compared to FD.; Trade-offs between climate change, eutrophication and acidification may affect CDSI's environmental performance.;",

    "abstract": "Ecologists have studied geographic gradients in biodiversity for decades and recently mapped the intensity of the “human footprint” around the planet. The combination of these efforts have identified some global hotspots of biodiversity that are heavily impacted by human-caused land cover change and infrastructure. However, other hotspots of biodiversity experience less intense modifications from humans. Relationships between species diversity and the human footprint may be driven by covarying factors, like climate, soils, or topography, that coincidentally influence patterns of biodiversity and human land use. Here, I investigated relationships between tree species richness and the degree of human modification among Forest Service ranger districts within the contiguous US. Ranger districts with more tree species tended to experience greater human modification. Using data on climate, soils, and topography, I explored mechanisms explaining the positive relationship between tree richness and human modification. I found that climate is related to both tree richness and human modification, which may be indirectly mediated through climate’s role governing productivity. Ranger districts with more productive climates support more species and greater human modification. To explore potential conservation consequences of these relationships, I also investigated whether the amount of area designated within highly protected conservation lands were related to climate, productivity, and topography. Less productive ranger districts with steeper slopes tended to experience the greatest relative amounts of conservation protection. Combined, these results suggest that complex relationships explain the geographic patterns of biodiversity and the human footprint, but that climate and topography partially govern patterns of each.",

Searching for plants that can survive in areas with high salt content and even have decorative value was the focus of our research. Thirty plants of Limonium gmelinii subsp. hungaricum were planted in clear river sand; another thirty plants were planted in Pindstrup, a growing substrate enriched with 40% clay. With the latter, we modeled the natural soil. In addition to the control tap-water treatment, plants received 50, 125, 250, 375, and 500 mM NaCl solution irrigation twice a week. The leaf sizes of plants planted in sand decreased proportionally with the increasing NaCl concentration, and their dry matter content increased. In the clay-containing medium, leaf sizes increased, even at a concentration of 375 mM, although the dry matter content increased only at high concentrations. Carotene content in both media became higher, due to the higher NaCl concentrations, while proline content in the plants grown in sandy media increased, even with the 125 mM concentration. With our present experiment we proved the salt tolerance of the taxon, and even the soil’s great importance in supporting the plant’s salt tolerance.",

For this reason and others, there is a critical need to provide One Health (OH) training to medical professionals early in their careers. 133 U.S. medical schools were surveyed for the incorporation of OH learning activities. Results showed that 56% of surveyed programs included OH-related subject matter, primarily in the context of preclinical classroom learning. This supports previous findings that OH education efforts in medical schools lag behind veterinary schools, with many veterinary schools already including OH as a central part of their curricula.A two week OH elective course for third year medical students was developed and implemented at Georgetown University School of Medicine. Topics such as emerging infectious diseases, zoonoses, vector-borne diseases, epidemiology, emergency preparedness, the human-animal bond, and effects of climate change on public health were discussed. The 21 participants were surveyed before and after the course regarding their knowledge and understanding of OH. Participation in the course enhanced the students' knowledge of OH and furthermore, the students' perception of the importance of incorporating OH within the curriculum and in their future careers changed significantly. This study provides clear evidence that successful integration of OH material is achievable at low cost through interdepartmental and interdisciplinary collaboration. A more holistic approach to health care that takes into consideration environmental, wildlife, and domestic animal factors, and introduction of concepts such as OH into the medical school curriculum, can help close the educational gaps identified in the surveys.",

This type of learning is particularly well suited to environmentally themed courses as student action can have a positive impact on the environment while developing students' conservation ethics and “soft skills” required for many conservation jobs. SL was incorporated into one of two sections of an existing, junior‐level elective course in plant biology. As a service activity, undergraduates participated in the removal of an invasive species (Lespedeza cuneata) along a local greenway. We asked whether students who participated in a modest amount of SL demonstrated greater knowledge of plant biology, stronger connections to their class community, and increased self‐efficacy for environmental action than students who do not participate in SL. Data on student content knowledge, perceptions of classroom climate, and views of one's ability to positively impact the environment were collected through surveys given at the beginning and end of the semester. Instructor‐generated content questions and two published, validated surveys—the Connected Classroom Climate Inventory and Self‐Efficacy for Environmental Action scale—were used. We found that SL students showed a slightly increased sense of community with their peers, which has been found to have positive effects on learning, but not an increased perception of their own ability to be an agent of social change. In addition, SL provided an ecological benefit, assisted the local community, and created a positive example of university students giving back to the city.",
