    "abstract": "Among many other options, seasonal weather forecasts and the use of cultivars that are better adapted to local climate and climate variability have been discussed as two potential supporting measures to assist farmer adaptation to climatic variability and change. In this article, we evaluate the potential benefit of combining these two measures, i.e., choosing specific crop varieties based on seasonal forecasts – focusing on the Central Rift Valley in Ethiopia. We base our value of information analysis on the available records of field trial data for publicly released crop varieties. We find that experimental evidence must be extended and improved in order to provide reliable evidence of yield performance differences between crop varieties, which is an essential prerequisite for exploiting forecast information. Classification of cumulative seasonal rainfall based on the modified Rainfall Anomaly Index provides a sharper distinction than using the standard tercile-based approach employed in the Ethiopian seasonal forecast communication. Even with a fairly optimistic interpretation of the evidence with respect to exploitable yield differences, we find only modest benefits of seasonal forecasts at realistic forecast accuracy for the region. Given the empirical limitations when assembling long-run yield data, the presented results have to be understood as a first approximation. Apart from sufficiently accurate forecasts, success of forecast-based cultivar choice will depend on (i) more reliable evidence on performance differences between crop varieties under different weather conditions, and (ii) changes in the current seed breeding and distribution system in developing countries, because the full potential of high-accuracy seasonal forecast information could only be tapped, if forecast-matching cultivars are being made available to farmers in time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Extreme events are becoming more frequent due to anthropogenic climate change, posing serious concerns on societal and economic impacts and asking for mitigating strategies, as for Venice. Here we proposed a dynamical diagnostic of Extreme Sea Level (ESL) events in the Venice lagoon by using two indicators based on combining extreme value theory and dynamical systems: the instantaneous dimension and the inverse persistence. We show that the latter allows us to localize ESL events with respect to sea level fluctuations around the astronomical tide, while the former informs us on the role of active processes across the lagoon and specifically on the constructive interference of atmospheric contributions with the astronomical tide. We further examined the capability of the MoSE (Experimental Electromechanical Module), a safeguarding system recently put into operation, in mitigating extreme flooding events in relation with the values of the two dynamical indicators. We show that the MoSE acts on the inverse persistence in reducing/controlling the amplitude of sea level fluctuation and provide a valuable support for mitigating ESL events if operating, in a full operational mode, at least several hours before the occurrence an event.",

This policy is expected to be a solution to the problems of forest degradation, poverty, and land tenure conflicts. This paper aims to: (1) determine criteria and indicators priority in land allocation policy for social forestry, and (2) analyze the effectiveness of land allocation policy for social forestry. This study uses Pairwise Comparison-AHP and scoring approaches. The results show that the environmental aspect is the top priority in land allocation policy for social forestry, followed by economic and institutional aspects. From environmental aspect, the main priority is to overcome estate forest encroachment issues, while from economic, the priorty of this policy is as a source of income for the communities who live in/ around the forest. The priority of institutional aspects is finding the way of how social forestry can create market network for social forestry commercial products. In terms of social aspects, social forestry is prioritized to overcome tenure conflicts between communities and government. Based on effectiveness index, social forestry land allocation policy is categorized quite effective with the value of 10.79.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the perceived effect of climate change on forest dependent rural livelihoods in Oyo State, Nigeria with the view of identifying possible adaptation strategies. A total of 208 respondents were randomly sampled from Olokemeji and Onigambari forest reserves in Oluyole and Ibarapa East LGA, respectively. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistical tools such as frequency distribution, percentages and inferential statistical tools such as Chi square and PPMC. Result shows that most farmers were males (68.3%), married (85.6%), had primary education (63.0%), Christians (68.3%), had farm size less than 5ha (98.6%), while 45.7% earned up to 20,000 monthly. Major livelihood activity was farming (100.0%) and trading of forest products (92.8%). Respondents were vulnerable to climate change effects with respect to undefined season (90.4%), shortage of food production (84.1%), reduction in crop yield (80.8%), pest and disease outbreak (77.9%) which affects their livelihood activities. Respondentsâ€™ perception of climate change effects was high (74.8%) and the level of adaptation strategies utilized is more than average (53.6%). Major adaptation strategies utilized were soil protection through tree planting (88.5%), planting of different varieties of NTFPs and TFPs (87.0%), practicing shifting cultivation (81.8%) and use of organic fertilizer (81.7%). Respondents indicate that change in rainfall pattern (61.1%), storm (49.0), flooding (48.1%) and landslide (45.7%) had serious effect on their livelihood activities. Significant relationship existed between farm size (r=-0.257; p<0.01), monthly income (r=-0.319; p<0.01) and perceived effect of climate change. Adaptation strategies (r=0.309; p<0.05) used was significantly related with perceived effect of climate change. Afforestation should be encouraged among forest dependent farmers in addition to adaptation strategies utilised against climate change.

    "abstract": "Human-induced atmospheric composition changes cause a radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere which is driving global warming. This Earth energy imbalance (EEI) is the most critical number defining the prospects for continued global warming and climate change. Understanding the heat gain of the Earth system – and particularly how much and where the heat is distributed – is fundamental to understanding how this affects warming ocean, atmosphere and land; rising surface temperature; sea level; and loss of grounded and floating ice, which are fundamental concerns for society. This study is a Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) concerted international effort to update the Earth heat inventory and presents an updated assessment of ocean warming estimates as well as new and updated estimates of heat gain in the atmosphere, cryosphere and land over the period 1960–2018. The study obtains a consistent long-term Earth system heat gain over the period 1971–2018, with a total heat gain of 358±37 ZJ, which is equivalent to a global heating rate of 0.47±0.1 W m−2. Over the period 1971–2018 (2010–2018), the majority of heat gain is reported for the global ocean with 89 % (90 %), with 52 % for both periods in the upper 700 m depth, 28 % (30 %) for the 700–2000 m depth layer and 9 % (8 %) below 2000 m depth. Heat gain over land amounts to 6 % (5 %) over these periods, 4 % (3 %) is available for the melting of grounded and floating ice, and 1 % (2 %) is available for atmospheric warming. Our results also show that EEI is not only continuing, but also increasing: the EEI amounts to 0.87±0.12 W m−2 during 2010–2018. Stabilization of climate, the goal of the universally agreed United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992 and the Paris Agreement in 2015, requires that EEI be reduced to approximately zero to achieve Earth's system quasi-equilibrium. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere would need to be reduced from 410 to 353 ppm to increase heat radiation to space by 0.87 W m−2, bringing Earth back towards energy balance. This simple number, EEI, is the most fundamental metric that the scientific community and public must be aware of as the measure of how well the world is doing in the task of bringing climate change under control, and we call for an implementation of the EEI into the global stocktake based on best available science. Continued quantification and reduced uncertainties in the Earth heat inventory can be best achieved through the maintenance of the current global climate observing system, its extension into areas of gaps in the sampling, and the establishment of an international framework for concerted multidisciplinary research of the Earth heat inventory as presented in this study. This Earth heat inventory is published at the German Climate Computing Centre (DKRZ, https://www.dkrz.de/, last access: 7 August 2020) under the DOI https://doi.org/10.26050/WDCC/GCOS_EHI_EXP_v2 (von Schuckmann et al., 2020).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Owing to climate change, population growth and tenurial changes, the past decade has witnessed high interest among migrant and settler pastoralist groups in the vegetal-rich customary lands of the Agogo Traditional Area. This has resulted in lease grants of large land areas to pastoralists by traditional authorities and usufruct families, for reasons of ensuring optimum use and gaining the highest returns from lands. This paper examines the implications of consequent competing interests over land resources between farmers and herders on indigenous farmer’s agricultural investment decisions. The study uses qualitative methods and empirical evidence is given by primary data from semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions in the case study area. Results indicated that land owners exploit lapses in customary land administration systems to allocate lands in exchange for money, to pastoralists while neglecting indigenous farmers’ land use rights. Thus, indigenous farmers report land tenure insecurity and a sense of deprivation from their customary lands. Despite tenure insecurity concerns, farmer’s agricultural investment decisions remain unchanged because such changes in investment decisions may reduce incomes and compromise their livelihoods. The findings herein contradict theoretical expectations and provide new perspectives for understanding the relationship between tenure (in)security and investment decisions.",

    "abstract": "Governments commit substantial time and resources engaging individuals and households to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. These approaches, based largely upon behaviour change theories, have been criticised for their limited reach and effectiveness by practice theorists who have offered an alternative approach, broadening the focus beyond individuals. While practice theory has provided valuable insights into the energy consuming activities of households it has gained limited traction as a way to analyse and inform government practices and policy making. We address this by applying a practice lens to climate change community engagement practices performed by Australian local governments. Drawing on 29 interviews with practitioners and analysis of 37 Australian local government climate strategies, we examine the bundle of practices that constitute climate change community engagement: recruitment, engagement and evaluation. We consider how these practices are situated vis-a-vis other climate governance practices (regulation, service delivery, infrastructure provision and advocacy) as well as internal local government processes. Using a practice lens reveals the weaknesses in current engagement approaches which we contend are limiting efficacy. We draw upon Spurling et al.’s conceptualisation of re-crafting, re-integrating and substituting practices to consider how climate change community engagement practices might be reconfigured to improve their effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is causing shifts in the amount and frequency of precipitation in many regions, which is expected to have implications for plant performance. Most research has examined the impacts of the amount of precipitation on plants rather than the effects of both the amount and frequency of precipitation. To understand how climate-driven changes in precipitation can affect grassland plants, we asked: (i) How does the amount and frequency of precipitation affect plant performance? (ii) Do plant functional groups vary in their response to variable precipitation? To answer these questions we grew 14 monocot and eudicot grassland species and conducted a factorial manipulation of the amount (70 vs 90mm/month) and frequency (every 3, 15, or 30 days) of precipitation under rainout shelters. Our results show that both the amount and frequency of precipitation impact plant performance, with larger effects on eudicots than monocots. Above- and below-ground biomass were affected by the amount of precipitation and/or the interaction between the amount and frequency of precipitation. Above-ground biomass increased by 21-30% when the amount of precipitation was increased. When event frequency was decreased from 3 to 15 or 30 days, below-ground biomass generally decreased by 18-34% in the 70 mm treatment, but increased by 33-40% in the 90 mm treatment. Changes in stomatal conductance were largely driven by changes in event frequency. Our results show that it is important to consider changes in both the amount and frequency of precipitation when predicting how plant communities will respond to variable precipitation.",

    "abstract": "Food is essential to provide energy for human cellular metabolism, and is usually made from plants or animals. Beside plants and animals, other important food sources are made by microorganisms, typically products of fermentation (e.g bread, wine, beer, soy sauce, etc). Nowadays, because of the increasing environmental pollution, climate change and population growth, is becoming challenging to keep the food supply safe, nutritious and sustainable. Importantly, the development of the synthetic biology field enable the engineering of cells that can be used in food manufacturing. These engineered cells can transform renewable raw materials into important food components, functional food additives and nutritional chemicals. This review discusses the major challenges in food industry and how synthetic biology has the potential to revolutionize the future of the food. Finally, the prospects and challenges of synthetic biology for a sustainable food manufacturing are discussed.",
