    "abstract": "Abstract. Growing conditions play a significant role in the yield and grain quality of winter wheat. Global climate changes and in particular in the meteorological situation in the regions typical for the crop presuppose conducting research on the newly created breeding materials for grain quality. The aim of the study is to determine the nature and magnitude of the change in important parameters of grain quality, under the influence of typical environmental conditions for growing common wheat. The working hypothesis suggests that most of the parameters have a good genetic basis that would allow the selection to lead to their increase. In a multi environmental field experiment involving five test locations over three consecutive years, changes in eight grain quality parameters were investigated reflecting different aspects of the end-use quality. The study involved 40 samples of wheat developed by the breeding company “Agronom” in the last 20 years. With the help of modern methods for statistical analysis, the effect of the main breeding factors “location”, “year” and “genotype”, the limits of variation and the correlations between them have been established. The real possibilities for selection and breeding of each parameter have been analyzed, against the background of the rest of the group. Quality parameters change significantly from the three factors studied. The interaction “genotype x year” has the strongest influence on each of them. The “location x genotype” interaction is not a factor that affects the parameters. Only Deformation energy shows a significant share of the genotype, while the other two factors have a negligible influence on it. Each of the studied parameters, without exception, changes both adequately (linearly, IPC1) and inadequately (nonlinearly, IPC2) when the conditions change during the studied seasons. This nature of change is the reason for the relatively weak positive correlations between the parameters, as well as for their low heritability coefficients in a broad sense. Against the background of the data, the values of Genetic advance are indicated, with which each of them can be increased by selection. There are both positive and negative correlations between the parameters, the direction and value of which must be taken into account in the attempt to change them. An effective selection can be made on the parameters Extensibility index, Deformation energy and P/L ratio which have the strongest genetic control (H2> 0.60), which against the background of the strong influence of the environment (“location”, “year”, “location x year”) can lead to genetic advantage with 12% (Extensibility index), 17% (Deformation energy), 51% (P/L) of their present value. A selection based on PC or Wet gluten content parameters that have a direct effect on overall quality can also be effective (H2 =0.58-0.63). Instead, it would be more prudent to monitor, not so much their quantitative, but their qualitative composition, the accumulation of known or new alleles of glutenins (Glu) and gliadins (Gli), for which there is specific information that they are directly related to high grain quality.",

    "abstract": "Developing rigorous ecological models is a fundamental goal of conservation biologists seeking to forecast biotic responses to climate change. A limitation of many models is they are amechanistic and lack integration of behavior, which is fundamental to animal biology. We integrated biophysical and agent-based models (ABM) to examine how behavior could affect the sensitivity of Plethodontid salamander activity time to climate. Specifically, our model used a temperature differential to stimulate plant climbing, a widely observed behavior among salamanders, which would allow salamanders to reduce body temperatures and associated dehydration rates. Consistent with expectations, predicted activity time was positively correlated with precipitation. The model showed that climbing plants increased activity time in drier conditions, particularly for smaller salamanders. The predicted importance of climbing behavior, a form of behavioral plasticity, was highly sensitive to assumptions about the threshold of water loss an individual was willing to tolerate. Because activity time is associated with fitness, increased activity time as a consequence of climbing behavior could moderate salamander sensitivity to shifts in weather patterns. Our results demonstrate the potential and importance of integrating behaviors into ecophysiological models when evaluating a species' potential sensitivity to climate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The frequency of salt marsh dieback events has increased over the last 25 years with unknown consequences to the resilience of the ecosystem to accelerated sea level rise (SLR). Salt marsh ecosystems impacted by sudden vegetation dieback events were previously thought to recover naturally within a few months to years. In this study, we used a 13‐year collection of remotely sensed imagery to provide evidence that approximately 14% of total marsh area has not revegetated 10 years after a dieback event in Charleston, SC. Dieback onset coincided with a severe drought in 2012, as indicated by the Palmer drought stress index. A second dieback event occurred in 2016 after a historic flood influenced by Hurricane Joaquin in 2015. Unvegetated zones reached nearly 30% of the total marsh area in 2017. We used a light detection and ranging‐derived digital elevation model to determine that most affected areas were associated with lower elevation zones in the interior of the marsh. Further, restoration by grass planting was effective, with pilot‐scale restored plots having greater aboveground biomass than reference sites after two years of transplanting. A positive outcome indicated that the stressors that caused the dieback are no longer present. Despite that, many affected areas have not recovered naturally, even though they are located within the typical elevation range of healthy marshes. A mechanistic modeling approach was used to assess the effects of vegetation dieback on salt marsh resilience to SLR. Predictions indicate that a highly productive restored marsh (2000 g m−2 year−1) would persist at a moderate SLR rate of 60 cm in 100 years, whereas a nonrestored mudflat would lose all its elevation capital after 100 years. Thus, rapid restoration of marsh dieback is critical to avoid further degradation. Also, failure to incorporate the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events that trigger irreversible marsh diebacks underestimates salt marsh vulnerability to climate change. Finally, at an elevated SLR rate of 122 cm in 100 years, which is most likely an extreme climate change scenario, even highly productive ecosystems augmented by sediment placement would not keep pace with SLR. Thus, climate change mitigation actions are also urgently needed to preserve present‐day marsh ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "High temperature is a major environmental stress that devastatingly affects wheat production. Thenceforth, developing heat-tolerant and high-yielding wheat genotypes has become more critical to sustaining wheat production particularly under abrupt climate change and fast-growing global population. The present study aimed to evaluate parental genotypes and their cross combinations under normal and heat stress conditions, exploring their diversity based on dehydration-responsive element-binding 2 gene (DREB, stress tolerance gene in response to abiotic stress) in parental genotypes, and determining gene action controlling yield traits through half-diallel analysis. Six diverse bread wheat genotypes (local and exotic) and their 15 F1 hybrids were evaluated at two different locations under timely and late sowing dates. Sowing date, location, genotype, and their interactions significantly impacted the studied traits; days to heading, chlorophyll content, plant height, grain yield, and its attributes. Cluster analysis classified the parents and their crosses into four groups varying from heat-tolerant to heat-sensitive based on heat tolerance indices. The parental genotypes P2 and P4 were identified as an excellent source of beneficial alleles for earliness and high yielding under heat stress. This was corroborated by DNA sequence analysis of DREB transcription factors. They were the highest homologies for dehydrin gene sequence with heat-tolerant wheat species. The hybrid combinations of P1 × P5, P1 × P6, P2 × P4, and P3 × P5 were detected to be good specific combiners for grain yield and its attributes under heat stress conditions. These designated genotypes could be used in wheat breeding for developing heat-tolerant and climate-resilient cultivars. The non-additive genetic variances were preponderant over additive genetic variances for grain yield and most traits under both sowing dates. The narrow-sense heritability ranged from low to moderate for most traits. Strong positive associations were detected between grain yield and each of chlorophyll content, plant height, number of grains/spike, and thousand-grain weights, which suggest their importance for indirect selection under heat stress, especially in early generations, due to the effortlessness of their measurement.",

Study focus: Global climate change and intensified human activities are making the hydrological processes at Fuhe River Basin experiencing dramatic changes. Although some studies have investigated their individual impacts on basin-scale water resources, their combined effects on hydrology have received little attention. In this study, future scenarios were constructed for three future periods, based on five global climate model outputs (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and a dataset of future land use projections under three shared socioeconomic pathways and representative concentration pathways (SSP-RCPs). Then, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to assess the relative changes in water balance components and extreme flow frequency under these developed scenarios. Furthermore, the hydrological response assessment methodology was improved from the original multiscenario ensemble flow forecast (MESF) framework, which not only strengthens the connection between climate and land use input changes but also adds more assessment items. New hydrological insights for the region: The flow at the outlet of Fuhe River Basin is expected to increase by approximately 27.1%− 30.2%, 24.7–39.0% and 35.5%− 43.5% in the 2030 s, 2060 s and 2090 s, respectively. Water availability will increase significantly in February, August and October and decrease in November and December. To the end of 21st century, surface runoff will have more than 100% increase. Future floods and droughts will be more frequent and severe under SSP5–8.5.",

The research was carried out for the agricultural region of central-eastern Poland, an area covering the Lublin Voivodeship. One-hour averages of automatic measurements of tropospheric ozone concentration in 2015–2017 were used for the study. The data were obtained from three measuring stations belonging to the Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Poland. The stations were located as part of the Air Quality Monitoring System in rural communes in the north-western, central and southern parts of the Lublin Voivodeship. Statistical analysis of the data showed that the tropospheric ozone concentrations were significantly dependent on weather conditions during the years of the study. At each monitoring station, the one-hour average O3 concentrations showed a clear structure over the course of the day: they were higher in the late morning and early afternoon than in the early morning and at night. The highest O3 concentrations were observed at the Florianka measurement station, located in Roztocze National Park. This area had high forest cover and was located at the highest elevation above sea level of the three measuring stations. In the light of climate change and increasing O3 concentrations, further scientific research on atmospheric air pollution is crucial, especially in agricultural areas associated with food production.",

    "abstract": "Plant litter quality is one of the key factors that control soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition. Under climate change, although significant change in litter quality has been intensively reported, the effect of litter quality change on SOM decomposition is poorly understood. This limits our ability to model the dynamics of soil carbon under climate change. To determine the effect of litter quality and soil property change on SOM decomposition, we performed a controlled, reciprocal transplant and litter decomposition experiments. The soils and plant litters were collected from a long-term field experiment, where four treatments were designed, including: (1) the control without warming at ambient CO2; (2) elevated atmospheric CO2 up to 500 ppm (C); (3) warming plant canopy by 2 °C (T); (4) elevated CO2 plus warming (CT). We found that elevated CO2 and warming altered the litter quality significantly in terms of macronutrients’ content and their stoichiometry. Elevated CO2 decreased the concentration of N in rice and wheat straw, while warming decreased the concentration of N and K in wheat straw. However, the change in plant litter quality did not lead to a shift in SOM decomposition. On the contrary, the legacy effect of long-term elevated CO2 and warming on soil properties dominated the decomposition rate of SOM. Elevated atmospheric CO2 suppressed SOM decomposition mainly by increasing phosphorous availability and lowering the soil C/N, fungi/bacteria ratio, and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase activity, while warming or elevated CO2 plus warming had no effect on SOM decomposition. Our results demonstrated that the changes in soil property other than litter quality control the decomposition of SOM under climate change, and soil property change in respond to climate change should be considered in model developing to predict terrestrial soil carbon dynamics under elevated atmospheric CO2 and warming.",

These characteristics included intensity, frequency, duration, frost-free periods, area distribution and historical trends. Maps of frost risk were determined for the entire river basin, by means of mathematical algorithms and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) tools, using minimum temperature &ndash; 1960 to 2002 period, geomorphology, slope, land-use, types of soils, vegetation and life zones, emphasizing the rainy season (September to April), when the impacts of frost on agriculture are most severe. We recognized four categories of frost risks: low, moderate, high and critical. The critical risks (with a very high probability of occurrence) were related to high altitudes on the basin (altitudes higher than 3800 m a.s.l.), while the low (or null) probability of occurring risks were found in the lower zones (less than 2500 m a.s.l.). Because of the very intense agricultural activity and the high sensitivity of the main crops (Maize, potato, artichoke) in the Mantaro valley (altitudes between 3100 and 3300 m a.s.l.), moderate to high frost risks can be expected, with a low to moderate probability of occurrence. Another significant result was a positive trend of 8 days per decade in the number of frost days during the rainy season.",

    "abstract": "Land salinization, resulting from the ongoing climate change phenomena, is having an increasing impact on coastal ecosystems like salt marshes. Although halophyte species can live and thrive in high salinities, they experience differences in their salt tolerance range, being this a determining factor in the plant distribution and frequency throughout marshes. Furthermore, intraspecific variation to NaCl response is observed in high-ranging halophyte species at a population level. The present study aims to determine if the environmental history, namely heavy metal pre-conditioning, can have a meaningful influence on salinity tolerance mechanisms of Spartina patens, a highly disperse grass invader in the Mediterranean marshes. For this purpose, individuals from pristine and heavy metal contaminated marsh populations were exposed to a high-ranging salinity gradient, and their intraspecific biophysical and biochemical feedbacks were analyzed. When comparing the tolerance mechanisms of both populations, S. patens from the contaminated marsh appeared to be more resilient and tolerant to salt stress, this was particularly present at the high salinities. Consequently, as the salinity increases in the environment, the heavy metal contaminated marsh may experience a more resilient and better adapted S. patens community. Therefore, the heavy metal pre-conditioning of salt mash populations appears to be able to create intraspecific physiological variations at the population level that can have a great influence on marsh plant distribution outcome.",
