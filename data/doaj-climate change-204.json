    "abstract": "Currently, many areas in Nigeria face strong water stress, and to reduce the pressure exerted on water, making water a reusable ecosystem service is essential. Economic efficiency of a water monitoring system can involve having a program to influence and manage water resources and the environment based on the utilization of modern information technologies and techniques. This article aims at demonstrating the importance of Economic efficiency of a water monitoring system, cases and deaths from water-related diseases by decade. A significant factor of managing water safety is understanding water availability, demand, utilization, how it acts in response to change, climate and pressures. Comprehensive understanding of a water system correctly and deeply depends on professionalism, monitoring, documentation and reporting of water system parameters. Human health risk assessment model was applied to estimate cases and deaths from water-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "The carbon embodied in buildings is an important proportion of our emissions and needs to be radically reduced in order to support climate change mitigation. The highest proportion of embodied carbon is usually emitted during the product stage, and within the structural elements. Therefore, reducing the carbon embodied in the structural materials is likely to have a major impact. In most buildings, the majority of embodied carbon comes from steel and concrete. But although there are now hundreds of registered Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) for cements and concretes, there has been very limited independent published information comparing the embodied carbon of different concrete mixes and raw materials. This lack of comparative data limits the potential to make appropriate decisions at early design stages leading to low carbon buildings. The authors have recently conducted a review of verified EPD for concrete mixes and for concrete’s key constituents, including cement, identifying the range of carbon coefficients. This paper provides guidance on making use of the coefficient ranges provided in that research: to support the verification of EPD for concrete and its raw materials; in material selection; in assessing building level embodied carbon; in benchmarking; and in the setting of reduction targets.",

    "abstract": "The long-tailed goral (Naemorhedus caudatus) is a critically endangered herbivore in South Korea. Despite government efforts to recover the population through reintroduction programs, the animal remains vulnerable to heavy snowfall. From March to June 2010, 24 animals were found dead due to heavy snowfall in the Wangpi Stream basin. In this study, we hypothesized that gorals that died due to snowfall are low-status individuals that lived in the sub-optimal or non-suitable areas. Using the occurrence data from extensive field surveys from 2008 to 2010 in the Wangpi Stream and the carcass location data, we (1) defined the goral habitat characteristics and (2) compared the habitat characteristics between dead and living gorals using ensemble species distribution modeling. The results suggested that the sites where dead gorals were found were highly related to typical goral habitats. These results implied that the optimal goral habitats could become uninhabitable following heavy snowfall. Most of the dead animals were pregnant females or were young, implying that they could not escape their primary habitats due to lower mobility. Thus, when there is a climate catastrophe, the optimal goral habitats should be considered for rescue and artificial feeding.",

    "abstract": "Globally, many freshwater ecosystems are facing chemical pollution from both natural and anthropogenic sources. The Olifants River Basin in South Africa is experiencing degradation due to mining, industrial, agricultural, and domestic activities. The impacts of these activities coupled with climate change is likely to shift the hydrological cycle that may increase accumulation of toxic chemicals in the sediments. The aim of the study was to assess the contamination of As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the sediments collected at the upstream, midstream and downstream of four rivers of the Lower Olifants River Basin; the Blyde, Mohalpitsi, Ga-Selati, and Steelpoort rivers. The highest concentrations of most of the trace metal (loid)s assessed were from the Steelpoort River followed by the Blyde River. Significant diﬀerences in metal concentrations were found across study sites and rivers. The overall assessment of the sub-catchment, which is characterised mainly by mining and agricultural activities shows significantly elevated levels of As, Cr, Mn, and Ni in the sediments and may cause secondary pollution in the water. Using enrichment factor (EF) and geo-accumulation index (Igeo), some of the sediments were severely enriched and extremely contaminated respectively with As, Cr, and Ni. This may risk the lives of aquatic biota and humans, especially rural communities that rely on these rivers for drinking water. The findings provide baseline information for effective management control of metal(loid) pollution in the Olifants River Basin.",

    "abstract": "Although improving energy efficiency has many benefits, including not only reducing pollution and climate change but also enhancing productivity and competitiveness, many firms still do not adopt energy efficiency innovation. In this study, we suggest inadequate attention allocation as a barrier to energy efficiency innovation, making firms fall into the intention-achievement gap when they simultaneously pursue multiple innovation-related goals. Due to limits in attention resources, competing innovation goals are likely to divert the firms’ focus of attention away from energy efficiency innovation, making them fail to achieve as much as they had initially intended. In addition, we argue that organizational innovation and government dependence will mitigate the attention dispersion effect of multiple goals by enhancing attention capacity and redirecting attention focus, respectively. We empirically examined our hypotheses in the context of Korean manufacturing industries between 2011 and 2013, using the Korean Innovation Survey 2014 data, and found supports for all hypotheses. In particular, we found that even a small increase in the diversity of innovation goals leads to a substantial likelihood of the intention-achievement gap and that organizational innovation and government dependence help to close the gap, but to a limited extent. Finally, theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Heavy precipitation events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in many parts of Europe as a result of climate change. These events can affect regions located far from rivers that have never been affected before. As warning times are short, there are hardly any effective emergency measures to mitigate the severe damage caused by pluvial floods. Therefore, long‐term mitigation measures are necessary for sustainable urban flood management. However, people first need to realise their personal risk in order to become active and take private precautionary measures. To get a better understanding of the processes underlying public risk perception of pluvial floods, a questionnaire‐based telephone survey was conducted analysing two case studies in western Germany. Key findings reveal that risk perceptions need to be distinguished between personal and global perception. Personal risk perception was low among the participants, while their global risk perception was far higher. The determinants of global and personal risk perception on pluvial flooding were identified. The study also showed that mitigation behaviour is influenced by personal risk perception, knowledge, education, and housing conditions. These determinants should receive attention when future risk communication and flood management strategies are developed.",

    "abstract": "Aviation has a large impact on the Earth's atmosphere and climate by various processes. Line-shaped contrails and contrail cirrus clouds lead to changes in the natural cirrus cloud cover and have a major contribution to the effective radiative forcing from aviation. In addition, aviation-induced aerosols might also change the microphysical properties and optical properties of naturally formed cirrus clouds. Latter aerosol–cloud interactions show large differences in the resulting effective radiative forcing, and our understanding on how aviation-induced aerosols affect cirrus cloud properties is still poor. Up to now, observations of this aviation-induced aerosol effect have been rare. In this study, we use combined airborne lidar and in situ ice cloud measurements to investigate differences in the microphysical and optical properties of naturally formed cirrus clouds, which formed in regions that are highly affected by aviation-induced aerosol emissions and, of those, which formed in regions rather unaffected by aviation. Urbanek et al. (2018) showed that those cirrus clouds, which are more affected by aviation-induced soot emission, are characterized by larger values of the particle linear depolarization ratio (PLDR). In this follow-on study we relate collocated lidar measurements performed aboard HALO during the ML-CIRRUS mission of the particle linear depolarization ratio with in situ cloud probe measurements of the number concentration and effective diameter of the ice particles. In situ measurements for both cloud types (high-PLDR-mode – aviation-affected – and low-PLDR-mode – pristine – cirrus) can be reliably compared in a temperature range between 210 and 215 K. Within this temperature range we find that high-PLDR-mode cirrus clouds tend to show larger effective ice particle diameters with a median value of 61.4 compared to 50.7 µm for low-PLDR-mode pristine cirrus clouds. Larger effective ice particles in aviation-influenced (high-PLDR-mode) cirrus are connected to lower ice particle number concentration with a median value of 0.05 compared to 0.11 cm−3 (low-PLDR-mode), which evolved in more pristine regions with only little impact from aviation. We suspect that a suppression of homogeneous ice formation by the heterogeneously freezing soot aerosol particles included in the areas affected by air traffic is the cause of the reduced ice crystal concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chad is the largest country of the Sahel region with different climatic zones, varying from arid in the north to tropical in the south. These climatic zones respond differently to climate change signals. Therefore, their detection over major cities, which are scattered within different climatic zones, is of utmost importance. The changes in hydroclimatic fields such as rainfall and temperature were examined over the major cities in various regions for the period 1950 to 2014. Rainfall shows a significant decreasing trend especially over cities close to Lake Chad (Lere, Mondou, Mongo, and Sarh), whereas no significant trend is observed for cities farther from the Lake. However, a consistently increasing trend in temperature is found across all cities. The cities in the north (Faya, Abeche, and Ati) receive far less rainfall than those located in southern Chad. All cities (except Faya and Lere) received higher rainfall during 1950–1965 (wet period), entering a dry regime between 1966 and 1990 (dry period) and subsequently recovering rainfall totals, toward previous levels, between 1991 and 2014 (recovery phase). A substantial rise in air temperature is observed after 1980–1985, reflecting the gradual rise of temperature in recent times. In summary, rainfall is recovering from a dry regime and temperature is rising over all the major cities of Chad. More researches in this region is needed to develop local scale mitigation strategies and adaptation technology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Change in global mean surface temperature (ΔGMST), based on a blend of land air and ocean water temperatures, is a widely cited climate change indicator that informs the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming since preindustrial to “well below” 2°C. Assessment of current ΔGMST enables determination of remaining target‐consistent warming and therefore a relevant remaining carbon budget. In recent IPCC reports, ΔGMST was estimated via linear regression or differences between decade‐plus period means. We propose nonlinear continuous local regression (LOESS) using ±20 year windows to derive ΔGMST across all periods of interest. Using the three observational GMST data sets with almost complete interpolated spatial coverage since the 1950s, we evaluate 1850–1900 to 2019 ΔGMST as 1.14°C with a likely (17%–83%) range of 1.05°C–1.25°C, based on combined statistical and observational uncertainty, compared with linear regression of 1.05°C over 1880–2019. Performance tests in observational data sets and two model large ensembles demonstrate that LOESS, like period mean differences, is unbiased. However, LOESS also provides a statistical uncertainty estimate and gives warming through 2019, rather than the 1850–1900 to 2010–2019 period mean difference centered at the end of 2014. We derive historical global near‐surface air temperature change (ΔGSAT), using a subset of CMIP6 climate models to estimate the adjustment required to account for the difference between ocean water and ocean air temperatures. We find ΔGSAT of 1.21°C (1.11°C–1.32°C) and calculate remaining carbon budgets. We argue that continuous nonlinear trend estimation offers substantial advantages for assessment of long‐term observational ΔGMST.",
