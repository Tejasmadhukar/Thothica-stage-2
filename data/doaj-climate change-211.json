    "abstract": "Variations in the uptake of atmospheric carbon by vegetation over India, the second-highest contributor to global greening, have enormous implications for climate change mitigation. Global studies conclude that temperature and total water storage (TWS) cause interannual variations of carbon uptake based on the correlation coefficient, which is not a causality measure. Here, we apply a statistically rigorous causality approach, Peter Clark momentary conditional independence, to the monthly observed satellite and station-based gridded dataset of India’s climate and carbon uptake variables. We find no existence of causal connections from TWS to gross primary production (GPP) or net photosynthesis (PSN). Causal relationships exist from precipitation to GPP and PSN. Since shallow-rooted croplands dominate India’s green cover, impacts of precipitation on carbon capture of the the land ecosystem are immediate and not via TWS. Our results identify the key climate drivers of GPP/PSN variability and highlight interactions between water and the carbon cycle in India. Our results also highlight the need for formal causal analysis using climate and earth sciences observations rather than the conventional practices of inferring causality from correlations.",

    "abstract": "Plastics are a precious, versatile set of materials. The accumulation of plastic waste threatens the environment. Recycling plastic waste can produce many new products. The many opportunities for using plastic waste create pressure for a strategy to develop or improve current waste management systems to reduce the negative impact on humans, fauna and flora. The objective of this review paper is to consider an opportunity to recycle plastic; to convert plastic waste into plastic sand bricks. This would reduce the impact of the four emerging crises (plastic pollution, unemployment, the shortage of affordable housing and climate change) identified in South Africa as a threat to sustainability. This paper reviews studies utilising plastic waste to manufacture materials for the construction industry. The feasibility of using plastic waste to manufacture bricks revealed high compressive strength, low water absorption and weighed considerably lower compared to traditional bricks. Plastic sand bricks, therefore, can provide a solution that can be used to curb the four emerging crises and contribute to sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Marine predators adapt their hunting techniques to locate and capture prey in response to their surrounding environment. However, little is known about how certain strategies influence foraging success and efficiency. Due to the miniaturisation of animal tracking technologies, a single individual can be equipped with multiple data loggers to obtain multi-scale tracking information. With the addition of animal-borne video data loggers, it is possible to provide context-specific information for movement data obtained over the video recording periods. Through a combination of video data loggers, accelerometers, GPS and depth recorders, this study investigated the influence of habitat, sex and the presence of other predators on the foraging success and efficiency of the endangered African penguin, Spheniscus demersus, from two colonies in Algoa Bay, South Africa. Due to limitations in the battery life of video data loggers, a machine learning model was developed to detect prey captures across full foraging trips. The model was validated using prey capture signals detected in concurrently recording accelerometers and animal-borne cameras and was then applied to detect prey captures throughout the full foraging trip of each individual. Using GPS and bathymetry information to inform the position of dives, individuals were observed to perform both pelagic and benthic diving behaviour. Females were generally more successful on pelagic dives than males, suggesting a trade-off between manoeuvrability and physiological diving capacity. By contrast, males were more successful in benthic dives, at least for Bird Island (BI) birds, possibly due to their larger size compared to females, allowing them to exploit habitat deeper and for longer durations. Both males at BI and both sexes at St Croix (SC) exhibited similar benthic success rates. This may be due to the comparatively shallower seafloor around SC, which could increase the likelihood of females capturing prey on benthic dives. Observation of camera data indicated individuals regularly foraged with a range of other predators including penguins and other seabirds, predatory fish (sharks and tuna) and whales. The presence of other seabirds increased individual foraging success, while predatory fish reduced it, indicating competitive exclusion by larger heterospecifics. This study highlights novel benthic foraging strategies in African penguins and suggests that individuals could buffer the effects of changes to prey availability in response to climate change. Furthermore, although group foraging was prevalent in the present study, its influence on foraging success depends largely on the type of heterospecifics present.",

    "abstract": "Earth Observation (EO) is widely recognized as a powerful tool for Climate Change and Sustainability Education (CCSE); however, the uptake of EO data in schools is still limited due to technical, motivational, or informational barriers. A major factor for the exploitation of EO in schools is the availability of curriculum-relevant pedagogical content that is attractive and personally meaningful to learners. Here, we examine whether an EO-based learning scenario developed for primary schools and implemented by EO novice teachers and students, based solely on written instructions, can serve as an effective entry point for incorporating EO into schools and addressing CCSE objectives. Our study showed that: (a) cloud-based EO tools are suitable for EO-novice teachers and students, who quickly become familiar with them and grasp basic EO concepts; (b) the combined use of EO-based and place-based learning helps students bridge the local and the global perspective of Climate Change (CC) impacts; (c) EO-based educational material stimulates students’ interest for satellites and EO technology; (d) the phenomenon-based approach grabs students’ attention, provokes their curiosity, and acts as a springboard for scientific inquiry on CC impacts; and (e) our scenario’s learning approaches promoted teachers’ upskilling and intra-school collaboration.",

China is undergoing an impressive build up of renewable capacity, in particular wind. Using data from the Clean Mechanism Development project database between 2004 and 2012, this study shows that while China made progress in bringing down the levelized cost of wind electricity and cost of carbon mitigation (CCM), serious grid-connection issues and high wind curtailment rates resulted in a levelized cost of wind electricity that is one-half to two times higher than expected, and a CCM that is four to six times higher. Sharp drop in electricity demand, utilization rate, and coal prices in recent years may lead to even higher results.",

The problems of bee pastures and the impact of the urban environment on bee life are discussed, and the last part of this research assesses the breeding of solitary bees and bumble bees in urban gardens. It has been established that beekeeping in cities is as demanding as in the country because romantic ideas quickly change into a physically demanding and time-consuming activity. This article offers specific suggestions based on theoretical knowledge of apidology and the practical zootechnics of beekeeping, and takes into account the specifics of climate and bee grazing in the intravilan of municipalities and towns.",

    "abstract": "The Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) is a useful tool for evaluating irrigation scheduling and achieving water conservation and crop yield goals. This study examined the CWSI under different water stress conditions for the scheduling of wheat crop irrigation and developed indices using the leaf canopy temperature in Faisalabad, Pakistan. The experiments were conducted using a randomized, complete block design and four irrigation treatments with deficit levels of D0%, D20%, and D40% from the field capacity (FC) and D100% (100% deficit level). The CWSI was determined at pre-heading and post-heading stages through the lower baseline (fully watered crop) and upper limit (maximum stress). These baselines were computed using the air temperature and canopy temperature of plant leaves and the vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The CWSI for each irrigation treatment was calculated and the average seasonal CWSI value for the whole season was used to develop the empirical relationships for scheduling irrigation. The relationships between the air canopy temperatures and the VPD resulted in slope (x) = −0.735 and interception (c) = −0.8731 as well as x = −0.5143 and c = −1.273 at the pre- and post-heading stages, respectively. The values of the CWSI for the treatment at deficit levels of D0%, D20%, D40%, and D100% were found to be 0.08, 0.61, 0.20, and 0.64, respectively. The CWSI values developed in this study can be effectively used to promote better the monitoring of irrigated wheat crops in the region.",

    "abstract": "Understanding hydrological responses to climate change and land use and land cover change (LULCC) is important for water resource planning and management, especially for water-limited areas. The annual streamflow of the Wuding River Watershed (WRW), the largest sediment source of the Yellow River in China, has decreased significantly over the past 50 years at a rate of 5.2 mm/decade. Using the Budyko equation, this study investigated this decrease with the contributions from climate change and LULCC caused by human activities, which have intensified since 1999 due to China’s Grain for Green Project (GFGP). The Budyko parameter that represents watershed characteristics was more reasonably configured and derived to improve the performance of the Budyko equation. Vegetation changes were included in the Budyko equation to further improve its simulations, and these changes showed a significant upward trend due to the GFGP based on satellite data. An improved decomposition method based on the Budyko equation was used to quantitatively separate the impact of climate change from that of LULCC on the streamflow in the WRW. Our results show that climate change generated a dominant effect on the streamflow and decreased it by 72.4% in the WRW. This climatic effect can be further explained with the drying trend of the Palmer Severity Drought Index, which was calculated based only on climate change information for the WRW. In the meantime, although human activities in this watershed have been very intense, especially since 1999, vegetation cover increase contributed a 27.6% decline to the streamflow, which played a secondary role in affecting hydrological processes in the WRW.",

Such temperature spikes during the reproductive stage of plant development can harm crop fertility and productivity. Here we report the response of short-term heat stress events on the pollen and pistil tissues in a commercially grown cultivar of Brassica napus. Our data reveals that short-term temperature spikes not only affect pollen fitness but also impair the ability of the pistil to support pollen germination and pollen tube growth and that the heat stress sensitivity of pistil can have severe consequences for seed set and yield. Comparative transcriptome profiling of non-stressed and heat-stressed (40°C for 30 min) pollen and pistil (stigma + style) highlighted the underlying cellular mechanisms involved in heat stress response in these reproductive tissues. In pollen, cell wall organization and cellular transport-related genes possibly regulate pollen fitness under heat stress while the heat stress-induced repression of transcription factor encoding transcripts is a feature of the pistil response. Overall, high temperature altered the expression of genes involved in protein processing, regulation of transcription, pollen-pistil interactions, and misregulation of cellular organization, transport, and metabolism. Our results show that short episodes of high-temperature exposure in B. napus modulate key regulatory pathways disrupted reproductive processes, ultimately translating to yield loss. Further investigations on the genes and networks identified in the present study pave a way toward genetic improvement of the thermotolerance and reproductive performance of B. napus varieties.",

The available significant wave height data were divided into groups corresponding to the present period (1951–2000), a first future period (2001–2050), and a second future period (2051–2100). For each time period, the parameters of the GEV distribution were specified as functions of time-varying covariates and estimated using the conditional density network (CDN). For each location and selected time period, a total number of 29 linear and nonlinear models were fitted to the wave data, for a given combination of covariates. The covariates used in the GEV-CDN models consisted of wind fields resulting from the Regional Climate Model version 3 (RegCM3) developed by the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) with a spatial resolution of 10 km × 10 km, after being processed using principal component analysis (PCA). The results obtained from the best fitted models in the present and future periods for each location were compared, revealing different patterns of relationships between wind components and extreme wave height quantiles in different parts of the Greek Seas and different periods. The analysis demonstrates an increase of extreme wave heights in the first future period as compared with the present period, causing a significant threat to Greek coastal areas in the North Aegean Sea and the Ionian Sea.",
