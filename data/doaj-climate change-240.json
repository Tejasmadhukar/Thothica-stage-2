    "abstract": "Climate change is causing rapid shifts in the abiotic and biotic environmental conditions experienced by plant populations, but we lack generalizable frameworks for predicting the consequences for species. These changes may cause individuals to become poorly matched to their environments, potentially inducing shifts in the distributions of populations and altering species’ habitat and geographic ranges. We present a trade-off-based framework for understanding and predicting whether plant species may undergo range shifts, based on ecological strategies defined by functional trait variation. We define a species’ capacity for undergoing range shifts as the product of its colonization ability and the ability to express a phenotype well-suited to the environment across life stages (phenotype–environment matching), which are both strongly influenced by a species’ ecological strategy and unavoidable trade-offs in function. While numerous strategies may be successful in an environment, severe phenotype–environment mismatches result in habitat filtering: propagules reach a site but cannot establish there. Operating within individuals and populations, these processes will affect species’ habitat ranges at small scales, and aggregated across populations, will determine whether species track climatic changes and undergo geographic range shifts. This trade-off-based framework can provide a conceptual basis for species distribution models that are generalizable across plant species, aiding in the prediction of shifts in plant species’ ranges in response to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Hypersaline tidal flats (HTFs) are coastal ecosystems with freshwater deficits often occurring in arid or semi-arid regions near mangrove supratidal zones with no major fluvial contributions. Here, we estimate that organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were buried at rates averaging 21 (±6), 1.7 (±0.3) and 1.4 (±0.3) gm-2yr-1, respectively, during the previous century in three contrasting HTF systems, one in Brazil (eutrophic) and two in Australia (oligotrophic). Although these rates are lower than those from nearby mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass systems, the importance of HTFs as sinks for OC, TN and TP may be significant given their extensive coverage. Despite the measured short-term variability between net air–saltpan CO2 influx and emission estimates found during the dry and wet season in the Brazilian HTF, the only site with seasonal CO2 flux measurements, the OC sedimentary profiles over several decades suggest efficient OC burial at all sites. Indeed, the stable isotopes of OC and TN (δ13C and δ15N) along with C:N ratios show that microphytobenthos are the major source of the buried OC in these HTFs. Our findings highlight a previously unquantified carbon as well as a nutrient sink and suggest that coastal HTF ecosystems could be included in the emerging blue carbon framework.",

This article explores the experiences of one young climate activist, Elsie Luna. The article is the product of conversations between the co-authors, augmented by written material by Elsie Luna. The article seeks to avoid adultism, that is, the power that adults have over children; hence it is written principally using Elsie’s own words, with minimal translation or interpretation. The article reflects on three key recent events in Elsie Luna’s activism: her approach to the London headquarters of several oil companies; her ‘dying’ symbolically at the BBC in Berlin; and her recent involvement in the large Extinction Rebellion actions in London. Findings The article suggests that these events offer insights on learning. Specifically, she is formulating views on sustainability, on system change and associated strategies, and developing a moral position on these matters. She has learned socially, from family and other immediate influences, and from activism. Thus, further, she has learned from experience, but has done so in her own self-managed way.",

    "abstract": "Thermokarst features are widespread in ice-rich regions of the circumpolar Arctic. The rate of thermokarst lake formation and drainage is anticipated to accelerate as the climate warms. However, it is uncertain how these dynamic features impact the terrestrial Arctic carbon cycle. Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured during peak growing season using eddy covariance and chambers at Illisarvik, a 0.16 km2 thermokarst lake basin that was experimentally drained in 1978 on Richards Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. Vegetation in the basin differs markedly from the surrounding dwarf-shrub tundra and included patches of tall shrubs, grasses, and sedges with some bare ground and a small pond in the centre. During the peak growing season, temperature and wind conditions were highly variable, and soil water content decreased steadily. Basin-scaled net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measured by eddy covariance was −1.5 [CI95 %±0.2] g C−CO2 m-2d-1; NEE followed a marked diurnal pattern with no day-to-day trend during the study period. Variations in half-hourly NEE were primarily controlled by photosynthetic photon flux density and influenced by vapour pressure deficit, volumetric water content, and the presence of shrubs within the flux tower footprint, which varied with wind direction. Net methane exchange (NME) was low (8.7 [CI95 %±0.4] mgCH4m-2d-1) and had little impact on the growing season carbon balance of the basin. NME displayed high spatial variability, and sedge areas in the basin were the strongest source of CH4 while upland areas outside the basin were a net sink. Soil moisture and temperature were the main environmental factors influencing NME. Presently, Illisarvik is a carbon sink during the peak growing season. However, these results suggest that rates of growing season CO2 and CH4 exchange rates may change as the basin's vegetation community continues to evolve.",

Along with genetics, recent advances have highlighted “epigenetics” as an emerging and promising field of research for the understanding of tree phenotypic plasticity and adaptive responses. In this paper, we review recent advances in this emerging field and their potential applications for tree researchers and breeders, as well as for forest managers. First, we present the basics of epigenetics in plants before discussing its potential for trees. We then propose a bibliometric and overview of the literature on epigenetics in trees, including recent advances on tree priming. Lastly, we outline the promises of epigenetics for forest research and management, along with current gaps and future challenges. Research in epigenetics could use highly diverse paths to help forests adapt to global change by eliciting different innovative silvicultural approaches for natural- and artificial-based forest management.",

    "abstract": "Current approaches to vulnerability assessment for disaster-risk reduction (DRR) commonly apply generalised, a priori determinants of vulnerability to particular hazards in particular places. Although they may allow for policy-level legibility at high levels of spatial scale, these approaches suffer from attribution problems that become more acute as the level of analysis is localised and the population under investigation experiences greater vulnerability. In this article, we locate the source of this problem in a spatial scale mismatch between the essentialist framings of identity behind these generalised determinants of vulnerability and the intersectional, situational character of identity in the places where DRR interventions are designed and implemented. Using the Livelihoods as Intimate Government (LIG) approach to identify and understand different vulnerabilities to flooding in a community in southern Zambia, we empirically demonstrate how essentialist framings of identity produce this mismatch. Further, we illustrate a means of operationalising intersectional, situational framings of identity to achieve greater and more productive understandings of hazard vulnerability than available through the application of general determinants of vulnerability to specific places and cases.",

Its recent application in South Asia also includes the projection of rainfall extremes. In spite of its wide application, a stringent validation of the model is yet to be reported. In this study, we assessed the performance of the model in simulating annual, monthly and extreme rainfalls over Bangladesh by using a number of statistical techniques, e.g., pattern (both spatial and temporal) correlation, root mean square difference (RMSD), mean absolute difference (MAD), Student’s t-test for significance, probability density functions, etc. The results indicated that the PRECIS model could capture the overall spatial pattern of mean annual and monthly rainfalls very well. However, the inter-annual variability was poorly simulated by the model. In addition, the model could not capture the rainfall extremes. A spatial aggregation of rainfall data did not improve the reliability of the model as far as variability and extremes are concerned. Therefore, further improvements of the model and/or its driving global climate model are warranted for its practical use in the generation of rainfall scenarios.",

One hundred and twenty randomlyÂ selected arable crop farmers were interviewed. Data were analysed by use ofvpercentage and mean score.

However, organic manure (M=3.32), use of inorganic manure (M= 3.08), crop rotation(M=2.86), and mulching (vM=2.82) were most preferred by the respondents The major reasons indicated forvuse of most soil conservation practices included enhanced productivity, high qualityÂ products, long term nutrient value and others. While most of the preferredÂ conservation practices hold great potential for increased production, income forÂ farmers and enhanced food security for the nation, some are implicated as causes ofÂ climate change. The more environment friendly and climate change sensitiveÂ practices are less popular among the farmers. The paper recommends concertedÂ efforts to promote among farmers the conservation practices that aid mitigation andÂ adaptation to climate change and at the same time enhance production.

Cover crops were seeded in fall and mown in late spring, leaved in the ground for mulching in DM or incorporated into the uppermost soil layers in GM. Such approaches were investigated in six vineyards in Italy, six in France, and two vineyards in Slovenia and Turkey.
