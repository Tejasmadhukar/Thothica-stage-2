    "abstract": "This review considers the available information on the potential impact of key environmental factors and their interactions on the molecular ecology, growth and aflatoxin production by Aspergillus flavus in vitro and in maize grain. The recent studies which have been carried out to examine the impact of water activity x temperature on aflatoxin biosynthesis and phenotypic aflatoxin production are examined. These have shown that there is a direct relationship between the relative expression of key regulatory and structural genes under different environmental conditions which correlate directly with aflatoxin B1 production. A model has been developed to integrate the relative expression of 10 biosynthetic genes in the pathway, growth and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production which was validated under elevated temperature and water stress conditions. The effect of interacting conditions of aw x temperature x elevated CO2 (2x and 3x existing levels) are detailed for the first time. This suggests that while such interacting environmental conditions have little effect on growth they do have a significant impact on aflatoxin biosynthetic gene expression (structural aflD and regulatory aflR genes) and can significantly stimulate the production of AFB1. While the individual factors alone have an impact, it is the combined effect of these three abiotic factors which have an impact on mycotoxin production. This approach provides data which is necessary to help predict the real impacts of climate change on mycotoxigenic fungi.",

    "abstract": "This research analyzes the Peruvian engagement against climate change through the impact of the per capita income on the environmental pollution in the national scenario during the annual period of 1980-2019. For this, the logic of the Environmental Kuznets Curve will be used, in which an \"inverted U\" curve shape affirms that the economic growth is favorable for the environment in the long term because an optimal income point is reached and pollution begins to decline. For this analysis, the national exports are included as a third variable, and also is considered a cubic regression equation to the original Kuznets model. Through the estimation by Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron unit root tests, Granger Causality Test, the Vector Autoregression Model (VAR) method and the Forecast Graphics, it is shown that, similar to other countries of the region, Peru is actually on the initial part of the curve, where income and pollution have a growing direct relation. Finally, the models that fitted the relationship of these variables were the original model and the model with exports included.",

    "abstract": "This study assesses the major chemical processes leading to acid extremes in a small, moorland stream in mid-Wales, UK, which has been monitored since 1979. Results suggest that base cation (mainly calcium) dilution, the \"sea-salt effect\", and elevated nitrate pulses, are the major causes of seasonal/episodic minima in acid neutralising capacity (ANC), and that the relative importance of these drivers has remained approximately constant during 25 years of decreasing acid deposition and associated long-term chemical recovery. Many of the chemical variations causing short-term reductions in stream acidity, particularly base cation dilution and organic acid increases, are closely related to changes in water-flowpath and therefore to stream discharge. Changes in the observed pH-discharge relationship over time indicate that high-flow pH has increased more rapidly than mean-flow pH, and therefore that episodes have decreased in magnitude since 1980. However a two-box application of the dynamic model MAGIC, whilst reproducing this trend, suggests that it will not persist in the long term, with mean ANC continuing to increase until 2100, but the ANC of the upper soil (the source of relatively acid water during high-flow episodes) stabilising close to zero beyond 2030. With climate change predicted to lead to an increase in maximum flows in the latter half of the century, high-flow related acid episodes may actually become more rather than less severe in the long term, although the model suggests that this effect may be small. Two other predicted climatic changes could also detrimentally impact on acid episodes: increased severity of winter \"sea-salt\" episodes due to higher wind speeds during winter storms; and larger sulphate pulses due to oxidation of reduced sulphur held in organic soils, during more extreme summer droughts. At the Gwy, the near-coastal location and relatively small extent of peat soils suggest that sea-salt episodes may have the greatest influence.",

Vi si sono andate sostituendo incertezze per gli effetti di questi profondi cambiamenti sulla distribuzione della ricchezza, sulla disponibilità di lavoro, sulla possibilità che lo sviluppo prosegua agli stessi ritmi degli ultimi decenni, sul suo impatto sull’ambiente, sulle conseguenze delle tendenze demografiche, sui rapporti di forza tra paesi, tra le imprese e tra queste e i consumatori. È oggi evidente la necessità di governare questi cambiamenti, prestando maggiore attenzione verso coloro che hanno difficoltà ad adattarvisi sia nei paesi avanzati, dove l’automazione e la concorrenza globale stanno spiazzando molti lavoratori impiegati in mansioni routinarie, sia in quelli emergenti e in via di sviluppo, dove le prospettive di conseguire ulteriori riduzioni della povertà si stanno deteriorando. Sono, queste, sfide cruciali per l’economia mondiale. The hopes, emerged with end of the Cold War, of increasing everyone’s well-being thanks to globalization and technological progress have been partly disappointed. These hopes have been replaced by uncertainties about the effects of these profound changes on the distribution of wealth, the availability of work, the possibility of development continuing at the same pace as the last few decades, its impact on the environment, the consequences of demographic trends, and the balance of power between countries, between companies, and between companies and consumers. The need to govern these changes is now clear, and greater attention must be paid to those who have difficulties adapting to it both in advanced countries, where automation and global competition are displacing many workers employed in routine jobs, and in emerging and developing countries, where the prospects for further poverty reduction are deteriorating. These are the crucial challenges for the world economy. JEL codes: F6, O33, Q54, J11",

    "abstract": "Major challenge in rice production is to achieve the goal of enhancing both food production and fertilizer use efficiency. Rice growth simulation model, ORYZA (v3) was used in the present study to evaluate the model under continuous flooded (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) regimes with different fertilizer nitrogen (N) rates with different N splits using a historical data of past 45 years. The model satisfactorily simulated crop biomass and nitrogen uptake at both irrigation regimes and fertilizers N rates and splits. The yield differences among the years were large due to climate change, but enhanced by N rates. The response of N curves was different at both water regimes. At 0 N rate, the slope for agronomic efficiency (AE) was high which tends to decrease with increase in N rates. With the one split basal application of N, lowest yield was found with high physiological efficiencies (PE), lowest fertilizer recoveries (RE) and lowest agronomic efficiency (AE). For both water applications and fertilizer levels, high yield with high nitrogen uptake, AE, RE and partial factor productivity (PFP) were witnessed high at four split (3:3:3:1), while having low physiological efficiency. The water productivity (irrigation + rainfall) WPI+R at basal in one N split for AWD at 150 kg N ha−1 was 1.19 kg m−3 and for CF was 0.82 kg m−3, whereas for 225 kg N ha−1 WPI+R of AWD was 1.50 kg m−3 and 1.14 kg m−3 for CF. In general, AWD exhibited high WPI+R with no rice yield penalty compared to CF. Splitting with the proper amount of fertilizer N resulted in good water productivity and nitrogen efficiencies, could lead to high rice yield.",

    "abstract": "The increasing quantities of organic residues are becoming one of the most important problems for climate change mitigation. Sustainable utilization technologies are required to minimize the effect of recycling on the environment. Nevertheless, treated residues should be part of the circular bioeconomy. One of the most promising processes is the biogas system, with the final products biogas and digestate, which contain valuable nutrients and are therefore suitable as agricultural fertilizers. However, there is lack of research data on the effectiveness of digestate on environmental factors including soil quality as well as crop productivity and quality. In this study, we compare the roles of different digestates (chicken manure digestate, cow manure digestate, and pig manure digestate) on spring wheat productivity, soil microbial activities, and greenhouse gas emissions in loam and sandy loam soil under controlled climate conditions. The liquid digestate applied was equivalent to 170 kg N ha−1 of total N presented. Overall, results showed that the two soil types responded differently to the addition of the digestates, and the benefits depended on soil characteristics as well as on the type of the digestate applied. There was a higher effect on soil microbial activity in sandy loam soil compared to that of loam soil. Chicken manure digestate had the highest value of dehydrogenase activity and soil microbial biomass C of 9.23 µg TPFg−1 h−1 and 175.6 µg g−1 across the two soil types. CO2 and N2O emissions were moderately higher in loam soil when compared to that of sandy loam soil. The highest CO2 peak emission at 0.0107 µg ha−1 h−1 occurred in pig manure digestate in the sandy loam soil, and regular peak patterns observed in loam soil fertilized with pig digestate manure. Chicken manure digestate had the highest peak emissions across both soil types at 0.007950 mg ha−1 h−1 and 0.5667 mg ha−1 h−1 in the loam and sandy loam soil, respectively. The biomass yield varied across the soil types irrespective of the digestate applied. The agricultural benefits of digestates in different receiving soil ecosystems supplying essential nutrients for crop productivity, coupled with its environmental benefits, makes it an encouraging prospect in temperate climate zones.",

    "abstract": "Stingless/meliponine bees are eusocial insects whose polylactic nature enables interaction with a wide variety of wild plants and crops that enhance pollination and, hence, support ecosystem services. However, their true potential regarding pollination services and honey production is yet to be fully recognized. Worldwide, there are over 800 species of meliponine bees, with over 20 species documented on the African continent. Out of these, only 12 species have been well documented in Kenya. Moreover, interest on meliponine bees has increased amid climate change, agricultural intensification, and other anthropogenic effects. Generally, stingless bees are under-researched, with no previous documented evidence of their ecological niche (EN) distribution in most African countries. Hence, this study sought to establish the influence of bioclimatic, topographic, and vegetation phenology on their spatial distribution and change patterns. Stingless response variables from 490 sample points were collected and used in conjunction with 11 non-conflating features to build stingless ecological niche models. Six machine learning-based EN models were used to predict the distribution of seven stingless bees’ species combined. The results from the EN models showed that annual precipitation was the most influential variable to stingless bee distribution (contributing 43.09% logit), while potential evapotranspiration and temperature seasonality contributed 21.18% of the information needed to predict the spatial distribution of stingless bees. Vegetation phenology (21.36%) and topography (14.36%) had moderate effect on stingless bees’ distribution. On the other hand, high seasonality in precipitation and temperature indicated high stingless niche variability in the future (i.e. 2055). The performance of six EN algorithms used to predict distribution of stingless bees was found to be “excellent” for random forest (true skills statistics (TSS) = 0.91) and ranger (TSS = 0.90) and “good” for generalized additive models (TSS = 0.87), multivariate adaptive regression spline (TSS = 0.80), and boosted regression trees (TSS = 0.80), while they were “fair” for recursive portioning and regression trees (TSS = 0.79). These EN models could be utilized to inform stingless bee farming and insects pollinated crops by highlighting regions that provide highly suitable conditions for stingless bees. Additionally, the findings could be harnessed to increase both bee and agricultural productivity and forest conservation efforts through supplementary pollination services.",

    "abstract": "Background Most carabid beetles are particularly sensitive to local habitat characteristics. Although in China grasslands account for more than 40% of the national land, their biodiversity is still poorly known. The aim of this paper is to identify the main environmental characteristics influencing carabid diversity in different types of grassland in northern China. Methods We investigated the influence of vegetation (plant biomass, cover, density, height and species richness), soil (bulk density, above ground litter, moisture and temperature) and climate (humidity, precipitation and temperature) on carabid community structure (species richness, species composition and functional diversity—measured as body size, movement and total diversity) in three types of grasslands: desert, typical and meadow steppes. We used Canonical correspondence analysis to investigate the role of habitat characteristics on species composition and eigenvector spatial filtering to investigate the responses of species richness and functional diversities. Results We found that carabid community structure was strongly influenced by local habitat characteristics and particularly by climatic factors. Carabids in the desert steppe showed the lowest richness and functional diversities. Climate predictors (temperature, precipitation and humidity) had positive effects on carabid species richness at both regional and ecosystem levels, with difference among ecosystems. Plant diversity had a positive influence on carabid richness at the regional level. Soil compaction and temperature were negatively related to species richness at regional level. Climatic factors positively influenced functional diversities, whereas soil temperature had negative effects. Soil moisture and temperature were the most important drivers of species composition at regional level, whereas the relative importance of the various environmental parameters varied among ecosystems. Discussion Carabid responses to environmental characteristics varied among grassland types, which warns against generalizations and indicates that management programs should be considered at grassland scale. Carabid community structure is strongly influenced by climatic factors, and can therefore be particularly sensitive to ongoing climate change.",

The evaluation methodology compares the ranking of the years determined by the climate-based indices and response-based indices from simulations, regarded as actual performance. The hygrothermal response of an old brick masonry wall assembly, before and after retrofit, was investigated in two Canadian cities under historical and projected future climates. Results indicated that climate-based indices failed to represent the actual performance. However, among the response-based indices, the freeze-thaw damage risk index (FTDR) showed a better correlation with the climate-based indices. Additionally, results indicated a better correlation between the climatic index (CI), the moisture index (MI), and FTDR in Ottawa; however, in Vancouver, a better fit was found between MI and FTDR. Moreover, the risk of freeze-thaw increased considerably after interior insulation was added under both historical and projected future climates. The risk of FT damage would increase for Ottawa but decrease for Vancouver under a warming climate projected in the future, based on the climate scenario used in this study. Further research is needed to develop a more reliable method for the ranking and the selection of MRYs on the basis of climate-based indices that is suitable for freeze-thaw damage risk assessment.",
