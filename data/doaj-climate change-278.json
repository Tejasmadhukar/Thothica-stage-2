    "abstract": "Phenology response to climatic variables is a vital indicator for understanding changes in biosphere processes as related to possible climate change. We investigated global phenology relationships to precipitation and land surface temperature (LST) at high spatial and temporal resolution for calendar years 2008–2011. We used cross-correlation between MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), MODIS LST and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) gridded rainfall to map phenology relationships at 1-km spatial resolution and weekly temporal resolution. We show these data to be rich in spatiotemporal information, illustrating distinct phenology patterns as a result of complex overlapping gradients of climate, ecosystem and land use/land cover. The data are consistent with broad-scale, coarse-resolution modeled ecosystem limitations to moisture, temperature and irradiance. We suggest that high-resolution phenology data are useful as both an input and complement to land use/land cover classifiers and for understanding climate change vulnerability in natural and anthropogenic landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Studying glacier mass changes at regional scale provides critical insights into the impact of climate change on glacierized regions, but is impractical using in situ estimates alone due to logistical and human constraints. We present annual mass-balance time series for 239 glaciers in the European Alps, using optical satellite images for the period of 2000 to 2016. Our approach, called the SLA-method, is based on the estimation of the glacier snowline altitude (SLA) for each year combined with the geodetic mass balance over the study period to derive the annual mass balance. In situ annual mass-balances from 23 glaciers were used to validate our approach and underline its robustness to generate annual mass-balance time series. Such temporally-resolved observations provide a unique potential to investigate the behavior of glaciers in regions where few or no data are available. At the European Alps scale, our geodetic estimate was performed for 361 glaciers (75% of the glacierized area) and indicates a mean annual mass loss of −0.74 ± 0.20 m w.e. yr–1 from 2000 to 2016. The spatial variability in the average glacier mass loss is significantly correlated to three morpho-topographic variables (mean glacier slope, median, and maximum altitudes), altogether explaining 36% of the observed variance. Comparing the mass losses from in situ and SLA-method estimates and taking into account the glacier slope and maximum elevation, we show that steeper glaciers and glaciers with higher maximum elevation experienced less mass loss. Because steeper glaciers (>20°) are poorly represented by in situ estimates, we suggest that region-wide extrapolation of field measurements could be improved by including a morpho-topographic dependency. The analysis of the annual mass changes with regard to a global atmospheric dataset (ERA5) showed that: (i) extreme climate events are registered by all glaciers across the European Alps, and we identified opposite weather regimes favorable or detrimental to the mass change; (ii) the interannual variability of glacier mass balances in the “central European Alps” is lower; and (iii) current strong imbalance of glaciers in the European Alps is likely mainly the consequence of the multi-decadal increasing trend in atmospheric temperature, clearly documented from ERA5 data.",

    "abstract": "Direct and indirect impacts of climate change are alarming in the coastal areas of the world, including the Mediterranean coasts. Extreme events (such as marine storms, medicanes, etc.) are likely to increase the coastal risks in the region (e.g., erosion, flooding, and inundation), resulting in a significant socio-economic impact, loss of natural biodiversity and ecosystem services, and damage to cultural heritage along the affected coasts. Therefore, climate-related risk assessment procedures are crucial for the management and sustainable development of coastal areas. The purpose of this paper is to review and analyze the literature on the assessment of both the long- and short- term effects of climate change on coastal Mediterranean areas. It emphasizes methods and techniques to evaluate coastal vulnerability and sea level rise risk. This paper presents an overview of relevant scientific literature on the matter with a focus on approaches used in addressing the issues on climate change, as well as the geographic distribution of papers on the topic, highlighting the main aspects addressed in different Mediterranean countries.",

    "abstract": "Industries, which are mainly responsible for high energy consumption, need to invest in research projects in order to develop new managing systems for rational energy use, and to tackle the devastating effects of climate change caused by human behavior. The study described in this paper concerns the forging industry, where the production processes generally start with the heating of steel in furnaces, and continue with other processes, such as heat treatments and different forms of machining. One of the most critical operations, in terms of energy loss, is the opening of the furnace doors for insertion and extraction operations. During this time, the temperature of the furnaces decreases by hundreds of degrees in a few minutes. Because the dispersed heat needs to be supplied again through the combustion of fuel, increasing the consumption of energy and the pollutant emissions, the evaluation of the amount of lost energy is crucial for the development of systems which can contain this loss. To perform this study, CFD simulation software was used. Results show that when the door opens, because of temperature and pressure differences between the furnace and the ambient air, turbulence is created. Results also show that the amount of energy lost for an opening of 10 min for radiation, convection and conduction is equal to 5606 MJ where convection is the main contributor, with 5020 MJ. The model created, after being validated, has been applied to perform other simulations, in order to improve the energy performance of the furnace. Results show that reducing the opening time of the door saves energy and limits pollutant emissions.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic halogenated organic chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) play an important role in stratospheric ozone depletion and contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect. In this work, the mid-infrared solar spectra measured by ground-based high-resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to retrieve atmospheric CFC-11 (CCl3F) and CFC-12 (CCl2F2) at Hefei, China. The CFC-11 columns observed from January 2017 to December 2020 and CFC-12 columns from September 2015 to December 2020 show a similar annual decreasing trend and seasonal cycle, with an annual rate of -0.47±0.06 % yr−1 and -0.68±0.03 % yr−1, respectively. So the decline rate of CFC-11 is significantly lower than that of CFC-12. CFC-11 total columns were higher in summer, and CFC-12 total columns were higher in summer and autumn. Both CFC-11 and CFC-12 total columns reached the lowest in spring. Further, FTIR data of NDACC (Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change) candidate station Hefei were compared with the ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer) satellite data, WACCM (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model) data, and the data from other NDACC-IRWG (InfraRed Working Group) stations (St. Petersburg, Jungfraujoch, and Réunion). The mean relative difference between the vertical profiles observed by FTIR and ACE-FTS is -5.6±3.3 % and 4.8±0.9 % for CFC-11 and CFC-12 for an altitude of 5.5 to 17.5 km, respectively. The results demonstrate that our FTIR data agree relatively well with the ACE-FTS satellite data. The annual decreasing rate of CFC-11 measured from ACE-FTS and calculated by WACCM is -1.15±0.22 % yr−1 and -1.68±0.18 % yr−1, respectively. The interannual decreasing rates of atmospheric CFC-11 obtained from ACE-FTS and WACCM data are higher than that from FTIR observations. Also, the annual decreasing rate of CFC-12 from ACE-FTS and WACCM is -0.85±0.15 % yr−1 and -0.81±0.05 % yr−1, respectively, close to the corresponding values from the FTIR measurements. The total columns of CFC-11 and CFC-12 at the Hefei and St. Petersburg stations are significantly higher than those at the Jungfraujoch and Réunion (Maïdo) stations, and the two values reached the maximum in local summer or autumn and the minimum in local spring or winter at the four stations. The seasonal variability at the three stations in the Northern Hemisphere is higher than that at the station in the Southern Hemisphere.",

    "abstract": "Soil moisture (SM) content is one of the most important environmental variables in relation to land surface climatology, hydrology, and ecology. Long-term SM data-sets on a regional scale provide reasonable information about climate change and global warming specific regions. The aim of this research work is to develop an integrated methodology for SM of kastanozems soils using multispectral satellite data. The study area is Tuv (48°40′30″N and 106°15′55″E) province in the forest steppe zones in Mongolia. In addition to this, land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat satellite images were integrated for the assessment. Furthermore, we used a digital elevation model (DEM) from ASTER satellite image with 30-m resolution. Aspect and slope maps were derived from this DEM. The soil moisture index (SMI) was obtained using spectral information from Landsat satellite data. We used regression analysis to develop the model. The model shows how SMI from satellite depends on LST, NDVI, DEM, Slope, and Aspect in the agricultural area. The results of the model were correlated with the ground SM data in Tuv province. The results indicate that there is a good agreement between output SM and SM of ground truth for agricultural area. Further research is focused on moisture mapping for different natural zones in Mongolia. The innovative part of this research is to estimate SM using drivers which are vegetation, land surface temperature, elevation, aspect, and slope in the forested steppe area. This integrative methodology can be applied for different regions with forest and desert steppe zones.",

Given the geographically isolated and spatially restricted peripheral ranges of arctic-alpine species, there is a good chance that many species of conservation concern irreversibly disappear from the regional flora under the ongoing climate change. In this study, we gathered all existing data on the presence of C. rupestris and focused on its current and future distribution in the Western Carpathians. We found that although the distribution of the species is fragmented and scarce, C. rupestris occurs in several mountain ranges, in four distinct plant community types, which differ considerably in altitude, geological bedrock, and other habitat characteristics. In contrast to the relatively broad range of occupied habitats, C. rupestris shows a narrow temperature niche (mean annual temperature range 0.4−4.0 °C). Ensembles of small models based on climatic characteristics and local topography show that regardless of the climate change scenario (rcp2.6, rcp8.5), many current occurrence sites, mainly in the peripheral zones of the range, will face the excessive loss of suitable environmental conditions. It is expected that the Tatra Mountains will be the only mountain range retaining potentially suitable habitats and providing possible refugia for this cold-adapted species in the future. Such severe shrinkage of distribution ranges and associated geographic isolation raises serious concerns for the fate of the arctic-alpine species in the Western Carpathians.",

    "abstract": "During austral winter, a compact low cloud deck over the South Atlantic contrasts with clear sky over southern Africa, where forest fires triggered by dry conditions emit large amounts of biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) in the free troposphere. Most of the BBA burden crosses the South Atlantic embedded in the tropical easterly flow. However, midlatitude synoptic disturbances can deflect part of the aerosol from the main transport path towards southern extratropics. In this study, the first objective classification of the synoptic variability controlling the spatial distribution of BBA in southern Africa and the South Atlantic during austral winter (August to October) is presented. By analysing atmospheric circulation data from reanalysis products, a six-class weather regime (WR) classification of the region is constructed. The classification reveals that the synoptic variability is composed of four WRs, representing disturbances travelling at midlatitudes, and two WRs accounting for pressure anomalies in the South Atlantic. The WR classification is then successfully used to characterise the aerosol spatial distribution in the region in the period 2003–2017, in both reanalysis products and station data. Results show that the BBA transport towards southern extratropics is controlled by weather regimes associated with midlatitude synoptic disturbances. In particular, depending on the relative position of the pressure anomalies along the midlatitude westerly flow, the BBA transport is deflected from the main tropical route towards southern Africa or the South Atlantic. Moreover, the WRs accounting for midlatitude disturbances show organised transition sequences, which allow one to illustrate the evolution of the BBA northerly transport across the region in the context of a wave pattern. The skill in characterising the BBA transport shown by the WR classification indicates the potential for using it as a diagnostic/predictive tool for the aerosol dynamics, which is a key component for the full understanding and modelling of the complex radiation–aerosol–cloud interactions controlling the atmospheric radiative budget in the region.",

    "abstract": "Most studies of evolutionary responses to climate change have focused on phenological responses to warming, and provide only weak evidence for evolutionary adaptation. This could be because phenological changes are more weakly linked to fitness than more direct mechanisms of climate change impacts, such as selective mortality during extreme weather events which have immediate fitness consequences for the individuals involved. Studies examining these other mechanisms may be more likely to show evidence for evolutionary adaptation. To test this, we quantify regional population responses of a small resident passerine (winter wren Troglodytes troglodytes) to a measure of winter severity (number of frost days). Annual population growth rate was consistently negatively correlated with this measure, but the point at which different populations achieved stability (λ = 1) varied across regions and was closely correlated with the historic average number of frost days, providing strong evidence for local adaptation. Despite this, regional variation in abundance remained negatively related to the regional mean number of winter frost days, potentially as a result of a time-lag in the rate of evolutionary response to climate change. As expected from Bergmann's rule, individual wrens were heavier in colder regions, suggesting that local adaptation may be mediated through body size. However, there was no evidence for selective mortality of small individuals in cold years, with annual variation in mean body size uncorrelated with the number of winter frost days, so the extent to which local adaptation occurs through changes in body size, or another mechanism remains uncertain.",
