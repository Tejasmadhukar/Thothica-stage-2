    "abstract": "The study ascertained the innovative adaptive measures used by farmers in northern Nigeria to cushion the harmful effects of climate change. Quantitative and qualitative approaches (Rapid Rural Appraisal, focus group discussions, and semi â€“ structured interview schedule) were used to elicit information from a total of 500 farmers, which were selected using multistage random sampling technique. Findings revealed that 84% and 79% of the farmers were aware and knowledgeable of climate change issues, respectively, while 81% of them noted that they had at various times experienced climate change incidences. Farmers reported that factors which informed their perception of climate change incidence were: unusual early rains followed by weeks of dryness (M= 2.84), erratic rainfall pattern (M= 2.66), drought (M=2.68), reduction in farm yields (M=2.68) and high rate of disease incidence (M= 2.67). Adaptive measures used by the farmers in northern Nigeria included: changes in planting dates (88.4%) and harvesting dates (85.4%), multiple cropping (81.8%), intensive manure application (69.2%), shift to different sites (56.8%) and use of wetland/river valley (fadama) for farming (52.6%). The study concludes that there is need for government to make concrete efforts to enact appropriate policies on climate change adaptation and assist local farmers in the short and long term to improve their resilience to climate change impact.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Global warming is leading to increased heat stress in many regions around the world. An extensive number of heat stress indicators (HSIs) has been developed to measure the associated impacts on human health. Here we calculate eight HSIs for global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). We compare their future trends as function of global mean temperature, with particular focus on highly populated regions. All analyzed HSIs increase significantly (p < 0.01) in all considered regions. Moreover, the different HSIs reveal a substantial spread ranging from trends close to the rate of global mean temperature up to an amplification of more than a factor of two. Trends change considerably when normalizing the HSIs by accounting for the different scales on which they are defined, but the large spread and strong trends remain. Consistently, exceedances of impact‐relevant thresholds are strongly increasing globally, including in several densely populated regions, but also show substantial spread across the selected HSIs. The indicators with the highest exceedance rates vary for different threshold levels, suggesting that the large indicator spread is associated both to differences in trend magnitude and the definition of threshold levels. These results highlight the importance of choosing indicators and thresholds that are appropriate for the respective impact under consideration. Additionally, further validation of HSIs regarding their capability to quantify heat impacts on human health on regional‐to‐global scales would be of great value for assessing global impacts of future heat stress more reliably.",

It is found that maximum PBF appears in January within the key area of 140° E–160° W, 50°–70° N. The key–area Pacific blocking in January is more active during the first (1980–1988) and the third (2009–2019) periods than during the second period (1989–2008). There is a positive 500 hPa–geopotential height (Z500) anomaly over the mid–latitude Pacific and a negative one over the high latitude area between the first two periods (second minus first). This pattern can cause an anomalous westerly circulation over the mid–high Pacific sector, which indicates a weakening of the Pacific blocking activity during the second period. This connects to a positive two–meter air temperature (T2m) anomaly over the northeastern Asia and mid–western Pacific, and a negative one over the high–latitude area. The difference of Z500 between the third and the second periods (third minus first) is opposite to that between the second and the first periods, which leads to more Pacific blocking events during the third period. This is related to a positive T2m anomaly over the high–latitude area and a negative one over the mid–latitude area of Asia and the western Pacific. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient between the variables (Z500, T2m, 200 hPa–zonal wind) and the key–area PBF confirms the above results.",

    "abstract": "For the hilly-plain-wetland complex ecosystem in the cold region of Northeast China, in order to solve the problems, which include the scarcity of surface rainfall stations and the inability to provide accurate surface precipitation for hydrological process simulation, based on the observed precipitation of rainfall stations, three remote sensing precipitation products are taken as objects of evaluation. They include TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) 3B42V7,3B42RT and CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data,CHIP). In this paper, the observation data of rainfall stations and IDWP precipitation data interpolated by IDW (Inverse Distance Weighted) are used as true value of precision comparison, and the detection accuracy of remote sensing precipitation products from 2001 to 2010 is evaluated on the time scale (day, month and quarter) and spatial scale in Naoli River Basin.The results of the study indicated that 3B42V7 and CHIP have a high detection accuracy for precipitation, and their CC (correlation coefficient) values are 0.47 and 0.49 respectively in daily time scale. The accuracy of their observation for monthly precipitation is better than that of daily precipitation, and the CC are 0.85 and 0.87 respectively. The multi-year average precipitation at different grid positions in the basin is overestimated by 3B42RT, and its evaluation results are poor at different time scales. For the precipitation intensity range of (0,20], the observed results of 3B42V7 and rainfall station are close to each other. For the precipitation intensity ranges of (0,1) and (50,+∞), 3B42RT and CHIP have overestimated or underestimated the precipitation in different degrees. Based on the above analysis results, 3B42RT can be considered as data that can detect whether precipitation occurs on different spatial positions in the basin. 3B42V7 and CHIP can be applied to flood forecasting and non-point source pollution control in cold regions. HIGHLIGHTS The research area of this paper is a hilly-plain-wetland complex ecosystem, and its climate state is complex, so there are few studies on this research area.; This paper studies the change of remote sensing precipitation with topography.; This paper makes a statistical analysis of the error changes of remote sensing precipitation;",

However, there is limited understanding of the factors that shape actors' perceptions of the fairness of decision-making processes, a concept known as perceived procedural fairness. I develop and test a set of hypotheses about the conditions under which actors that participate in the same environmental decision-making processes perceive the fairness of those processes differently. The study draws upon data from a survey of policy actors participating in task forces, steering committees, and other forums that guide climate change adaptation decision-making in the Lake Victoria basin in East Africa. These actors vary significantly in power and capacity, which raises questions of the degree to which forums provide meaningful opportunities for all actors to contribute to decision making. Findings indicate that among pairs of actors participating in any given forum, satisfaction with procedural fairness is higher among actors with greater social capital, operating at higher administrative levels, and with larger numbers of staff members. Additionally, donor organizations perceived higher levels of procedural fairness compared to civil society, government, and international nongovernmental organizations. These results have implications for efforts to improve the efficacy and legitimacy of environmental policy making in the Lake Victoria basin, as well as other transboundary governance systems in developing regions.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Climate change has numerous effects on poultry that result in welfare concerns and economic losses in agricultural industries. However, the mechanisms underlying the acclimation to heat stress in poultry have not been comprehensively defined. Therefore, identifying associated patterns of gene regulation and understanding the molecular mechanisms of acclimation to a warmer environment will provide insights into the acclimation system of broiler chickens. We profiled differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with differences in growth performance under heat stress conditions in the liver tissues of broilers based on RNA sequencing data. The DEGs were identified by comparison to the gene expression levels of broilers exhibiting average growth at 28 d of age (D28A) and D36A relative to those at D21A. In D36A, 507 and 312 DEGs were up- and downregulated, respectively, whereas 400 and 156 DEGs were up- and downregulated in D28A, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis further revealed that “fatty acid degradation” and “heat shock protein expression” were upregulated in broilers exhibiting a higher growth and weight, whereas “cell cycle arrest” and “amino acid metabolism” were downregulated. Transcriptome profiling revealed that the acclimatized group supplied fat and energy from the liver to tissues through the breakdown of fatty acids. Furthermore, homeostasis was maintained via heat shock proteins and antioxidant enzymes. The characterized candidate genes and mechanisms associated with the response to heat stress might serve as a foundation for improving the ability of broilers to acclimatize under heat stress conditions.",

However, little is known about how microbial communities and their underlying metabolic processes will be affected by these environmental changes in freshwater sedimentary systems. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed sediments from Lake Hazen, NU Canada. Here, we exploit the spatial heterogeneity created by varying runoff regimes across the watershed of this uniquely large high-latitude lake to test how a transition from low to high runoff, used as one proxy for climate change, affects the community structure and functional potential of dominant microbes. Based on metagenomic analyses of lake sediments along these spatial gradients, we show that increasing runoff leads to a decrease in taxonomic and functional diversity of sediment microbes. Our findings are likely to apply to other, smaller, glacierized watersheds typical of polar or high latitude ecosystems; we can predict that such changes will have far reaching consequences on these ecosystems by affecting nutrient biogeochemical cycling, the direction and magnitude of which are yet to be determined.",

Literatüre bakıldığında blok zinciri ile ilgili çalışmaların hızla arttığı ve farklı alanlara yayıldığı görülmektedir. Bu alanlardan birisi blok zinciri teknolojisinin çevreye olan etkileri üzerinedir. Yaşadığımız yüzyılın öncelikli sorun alanlarından biri olan iklim krizi ve doğal afetlerle başa çıkmanın bir yolu olarak yeni teknolojilerin çevre üzerindeki potansiyel etkilerinin tespiti ve önlem alınması adına konunun değerlendirilmesi gerekmektedir. Blok zinciri devletlerin de yoğun ilgisini çekmiş durumdadır. Otuzdan fazla ülkede blok zinciri konusunda pilot çalışmalar yürütülmektedir. Kamu politikaları açısından ele alındığında devletlerin bu teknolojiye ilgisi konuyu önemli kılmaktadır. Teknoloji baş döndürücü hızla ilerlerken bu ilerlemede çevre faktörünün gözetilmesi sürdürülebilir bir gelecek için zaruridir. Blok zinciri teknolojisinin bu süreçte yüksek enerji tüketimi nedeniyle doğaya zararları eleştirilirken yeşil teknoloji çalışmalarında ele alınmaya başlanması önemli bir evrimdir.

ABSTRACT: After Nakamato revealed the blockchain in 2008, it didn’t take long to discover that this technology is not just about cryptocurrencies. When we look at the literature, it is seen that the studies on the blockchain have increased rapidly and spread to different areas. One of these areas is on the effects of blockchain technology on the environment. The issue should be evaluated in order to determine the potential effects of new technologies on the environment and take precautions as a way of coping with the climate crisis and natural disasters, which is one of the priority problem areas of the century we live in. Blockchain has also attracted the attention of governments. Pilot studies on blockchain are carried out in more than thirty countries. From public policy perspective, the state’s interest in this technology makes the subject important. While technology is advancing at a dizzying pace, it is essential for a sustainable future to consider the environmental impact in this progress. It is an important evolution that blockchain technology is being discussed in green technology studies while being criticized for its high energy consumption in this process. In this context, examining the consistency of literature and practice will contribute to the literature. For this purpose, blockchain projects were examined by a content analysis method and the positive and negative effects of this technology on the environment were determined. After the content analysis, a semi-structured interview was held with the Aksa Electricity official, who traded the International Renewable Energy Certificate (I-REC) in licensed electricity generation for the first time in Turkey with the blockchain, and the founder of Foton Energy, a blockchain-based platform in the energy sector. As a result of the research, it has been seen that there is a decrease in energy need thanks to the developments in the consensus mechanisms of the blockchain technology. In addition, projects such as recycling and energy generation from renewable sources by using blockchain infrastructure give legitimacy to blockchain technology. At the same time, blockchain technology creates a marketing pillar in the energy sector.",

    "abstract": "Fossil fuels are dominant as an energy source, typically producing carbon dioxide (CO2) and enhancing global climate change. The present work reports the application of low-cost tri-sodium phosphate (TSP) to capture CO2 from model flue gas (CO2 + N2) mixture, in a batch mode and fixed-bed setup. It is observed that TSP has a high CO2 capture capacity as well as high CO2 selectivity. At ambient temperature, TSP shows a maximum CO2 capture capacity of 198 mg CO2/g of TSP. Furthermore, the CO2 capture efficiency of TSP over a flue gas mixture was found to be more than 90%. Fresh and spent materials were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Preliminary experiments were also conducted to evaluate the performance of regenerated TSP. The spent TSP was regenerated using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and its recyclability was tested for three consecutive cycles. A conceptual prototype for post-combustion CO2 capture based on TSP material has also been discussed.",
