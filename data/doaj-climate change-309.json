    "abstract": "A probe was carried out to ascertain fisherfolk ownership of physical assets for fisheries activities in fishing communitiesâ€™ vis-Ã -vis implication of climate change around Kainji Lake. Interview schedule was employed to generate primary data from 165 respondents in eleven fishing communities on western side of the lake and analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. Information on personal characteristics revealed that most of the respondents were advanced in age, small scale artisan fisherfolk with many years of experience, self employed and married with children but had poor education. Physical assets owned fall into three categories of fishing asset (33.3%), fish processing asset (41.7%) and accessories (25%). Conspicuous assets owned were fishing net, wooden canoe, hook & line, fish drying net, improved banda and modified drum smoking kiln. Physical assets that use wood and fuelwood which impinged on climate change were fishing canoe, improved banda and modified drum smoking kiln. Correlates of improved banda and modified drum kiln were marital status and number of wives. It implies that marital familyâ€™s ownership of fish smoking processing assets contributed to climate change problems through deforestation thereby causing desertification, soil erosion, destruction of ecosystem and weather variations with serious consequences on water bodies, fisheries, and livelihood in fishery around the lake. Worrisome is zero ownership of solar tent dryer which uses renewable energy of the sun and friendly to climate change adaptation. In view of prevailing evidence, adaptation to climate change is subject to modification of solar net drier to meet fish smoking needs. In alternative is exploration of biomass energy sources that is sustainable like rice husk for fish smoking as a mitigation strategy.",

    "abstract": "Shallow lakes and ponds constitute a significant number of water bodies worldwide. Many are heterotrophic, indicating that they are likely net contributors to global carbon cycling. Climate change is likely to have important impacts on these waterbodies. In this study, we examined two small Minnesota ponds; a permanent woodland pond and a temporary prairie pond. The woodland pond had lower levels of phosphorus and phytoplankton than the prairie pond. Using the open water oxygen method, we found the prairie pond typically had a higher level of gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) than the woodland pond, although the differences between the ponds varied with season. Despite the differences in GPP and R between the ponds the net ecosystem production was similar with both being heterotrophic. Since abundant small ponds may play an important role in carbon cycling and are likely to undergo changes in temperature and hydroperiod associated with climate change, understanding pond metabolism is critical in predicting impacts and designing management schemes to mitigate changes.",

    "abstract": "Dry forests are home to large amounts of biodiversity, are providers of ecosystem services, and control the advance of deserts. However, globally, these ecosystems are being threatened by various factors such as climate change, deforestation, and land use and land cover (LULC). The objective of this study was to identify the dynamics of LULC changes and the factors associated with the transformations of the dry forest in the Tumbes region (Peru) using Google Earth Engine (GEE). For this, the annual collection of Sentinel 2 (S2) satellite images of 2017 and 2021 was analyzed. Six types of LULC were identified, namely urban area (AU), agricultural land (AL), land without or with little vegetation (LW), water body (WB), dense dry forest (DDF), and open dry forest (ODF). Subsequently, we applied the Random Forest (RF) method for the classification. LULC maps reported accuracies greater than 89%. In turn, the rates of DDF and ODF between 2017 and 2021 remained unchanged at around 82%. Likewise, the largest net change occurred in the areas of WB, AL, and UA, at 51, 22, and 21%, respectively. Meanwhile, forest cover reported a loss of 4% (165.09 km2) of the total area in the analyzed period (2017–2021). The application of GEE allowed for an evaluation of the changes in forest cover and land use in the dry forest, and from this, it provided important information for the sustainable management of this ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Cross-country skiing has a long history in Finland, and it is a part of the national identity of Finns. This study on cross-country skiers’ adaptation to changing climate describes groups of cross-country skiers with reference to their motives for skiing, and their perceptions and preferences on climate change adaptation tools. The data was collected by means of a web questionnaire contacting skiers in ski areas, mainly in southern Finland, and on the websites of ski associations. On the basis of a cluster analysis, we found three groups of skier types, each of which has different perceptions of means for adapting their skiing behaviour to the decreasing skiing opportunities close to home. One group of skiers, the ‘social type’ group, placed emphasis on skiing traditions and social reasons. This group is the most liable to give up skiing if the skiing conditions close to home are poor. The ‘outdoor type’ group, whose skiing motives were related to skiing environment qualities (nature, landscape, winter) and the ‘technical type’ group motivated by fitness objectives, were interested in behavioural adaptation, for example, travelling further away and using artificial snow tracks. With a better understanding of skiers’ behaviour, it is possible to identify adaptation strategies that can help providers of skiing services, such as municipal agencies and the ski tourism industry, as well as skiers themselves, to prepare for climate change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A recent study reported a notable westerly‐monsoon interplay (WMI) to the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau in boreal summer. However, this study introduces another striking and unique WMI over the southeastern TP (SETP) in late spring (May), emphasizing the critical roles of the upstream mid‐latitude westerly and the downstream Bay of Bengal (BOB) summer monsoon (BOBSM) in linking interannual variations of precipitation over SETP. In this study, the research SETP domain (22.5°–27.5°N, 87.5°–97.5°E) as well as a westerly index (WI) over the pivotal upstream westerly domain (22.5°–30°N, 65°–80°E) and a monsoon index (MI) over the pivotal downstream BOBSM domain (12.5°–22.5°N, 87.5°–100°E) are defined to investigate connections between the westerly and BOBSM and their combined effects on precipitation over SETP. The results indicate that the mid‐latitude westerly and BOBSM show opposite effects on precipitation over SETP. The weaker westerly and the stronger BOBSM correspond to enhanced SETP precipitation, and vice versa. The enhanced BOBSM acts as a predominant role on the strengthening of precipitation, while the decelerated westerly plays a secondary dynamical amplification role. To quantify their synergistic roles in linking SETP precipitation, a WMI index is defined. Statistical analysis suggests that this newly defined WMI index has a higher positive correlation with the precipitation over SETP. The correlation has a prominent increase compared to individual correlations between WI/MI and SETP precipitation, and dynamic conditions in high WMI index years are more favorable for the formation of SETP precipitation. The possible mechanism is that the BOBSM southerly strengthens and the southern branch of the upstream mid‐latitude westerly weakens in high WMI index years, resulting in an anomalous cyclone over the northwestern BOB and an anomalous anticyclone over the western TP. The anomalous cyclone resembles a Rossby wave response to the increased precipitation over SETP, and the precipitation in turn contributes to maintaining the BOB cyclonic anomaly and the above anticyclonic anomaly via the latent heating release. This positive feedback effect is conducive to enhanced SETP precipitation.",

    "abstract": "In wine growing regions around the world, climate change has the potential to affect vine transpiration and overall vineyard water use due to related changes in daily atmospheric conditions and soil water deficits. Grapevines control their transpiration in response to such changes by regulating conductance of water through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. The response of bulk stomatal conductance, the vine canopy equivalent of stomatal conductance, to such changes were studied on Cabernet-Sauvignon, Merlot, Tempranillo, Ugni blanc, and Semillon vines in a non-irrigated vineyard in Bordeaux France. Whole-vine sap flow, temperature and humidity in the vine canopy, and net radiation absorbed by the vine canopy were measured on 15-minute intervals from early July through mid-September 2020, together with periodic measurements of leaf area, canopy porosity, and predawn leaf water potential. From these data, bulk stomatal conductance was calculated on 15-minute intervals, and multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify key variables and their relative effect on conductance. For the regression analysis, attention was focused on addressing non-linearity and collinearity in the explanatory variables and developing a model that was readily interpretable. Variability of vapour pressure deficit in the vine canopy over the day and predawn water potential over the season explained much of the variability in bulk stomatal conductance overall, with relative differences between varieties appearing to be driven in large part by differences in conductance response to predawn water potential between the varieties. Transpiration simulations based on the regression equations found similar differences between varieties in terms of daily and seasonal transpiration. These simulations also compared well with those from an accepted vineyard water balance model, although there appeared to be differences between the two approaches in the rate at which conductance, and hence transpiration is reduced as a function of decreasing soil water content (i.e., increasing water deficit stress). By better characterizing the response of bulk stomatal conductance, the dynamics of vine transpiration can be better parameterized in vineyard water use modeling of current and future climate scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Spatial and temporal variability characterize submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) assemblages, but understanding the complex interactions of environmental drivers of SAV assemblages remains elusive. We documented SAV composition and biomass across a salinity gradient in a coastal estuary over 12 mo. Ten macrophyte species were identified. The dominant species, Ceratophyllum demersum and Myriophyllum spicatum, accounted for over 40% of total biomass. Only Ruppia maritima occurred across the salinity gradient. Salinity, water depth and clarity delineated 3 assemblages: a saline assemblage, and 2 groups of fresher-water species, one associated with deeper water and lower water clarity and the other associated with shallow water and higher water clarity. These assemblages exhibited intra-annual variation, with at least 5 times more biomass in late spring/mid-summer compared to early winter. This pattern was consistent across the estuary, although the difference between peak and low biomass varied by habitat type; brackish exhibited the greatest magnitude. This variation is likely due to higher variation in salinity and the species composition of this habitat. As climate change and coastal restoration impact timing and range of salinity, water depth and clarity in this region, these data can be used to help inform predictive models and management decisions.",

    "abstract": "The source regions of the Yangtze River (SRYZ) and the Yellow River (SRYR) are sensitive areas of global climate change. Hence, determining the variation characteristics of the runoff and the main influencing factors in this region would be of great significance. In this study, different methods were used to quantify the contributions of climate change and other environmental factors to the runoff variation in the two regions, and the similarities and differences in the driving mechanisms of runoff change in the two regions were explored further. First, the change characteristics of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and runoff were analyzed through the observational data of the basin. Then, considering the non-linearity and non-stationarity of the runoff series, a heuristic segmentation algorithm method was used to divide the entire study period into natural and impacted periods. Finally, the effects of climate change and other environmental factors on runoff variation in two regions were evaluated comprehensively using three methods, including the improved double mass curve (IDMC), the slope change ratio of cumulative quantity (SCRCQ), and the Budyko-based elasticity (BBE). Results indicated that the annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration increased during the study period in the two regions. However, the runoff increased in the SRYZ and decreased in the SRYR. The intra-annual distribution of the runoff in the SRYZ was unimodal during the natural period and bimodal in the SRYR. The mutation test indicated that the change points of annual runoff series in the SRYZ and SRYR occurred in 2004 and 1989, respectively. The attribution analysis methods yielded similar results that climate change had the greatest effect on the runoff variation in the SRYZ, with a contribution of 59.6%~104.6%, and precipitation contributed 65.3%~109.6% of the increase in runoff. In contrast, the runoff variation in the SRYR was mainly controlled by other environmental factors such as permafrost degradation, land desertification, and human water consumption, which contributed 83.7%~96.5% of the decrease in the runoff. The results are meaningful for improving the efficiency of water resources utilization in the SRYZ and SRYR.",

    "abstract": "Increasing extreme climate events, intensifying traffic patterns and long-term underinvestment have led to the escalated deterioration of bridges within our road and rail transport networks. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems provide a means of objectively capturing and quantifying deterioration under operational conditions. Computer vision technology has gained considerable attention in the field of SHM due to its ability to obtain displacement data using non-contact methods at long distances. Additionally, it provides a low cost, rapid instrumentation solution with low interference to the normal operation of structures. However, even in the case of a medium span bridge, the need for many cameras to capture the global response can be cost-prohibitive. This research proposes a roving camera technique to capture a complete derivation of the response of a laboratory model bridge under live loading, in order to identify bridge damage. Displacement is identified as a suitable damage indicator, and two methods are used to assess the magnitude of the change in global displacement under changing boundary conditions in the laboratory bridge model. From this study, it is established that either approach could detect damage in the simulation model, providing an SHM solution that negates the requirement for complex sensor installations.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to analyse the economy-wide implications of a carbon tax applied on the Chilean electricity generation sector. In order to analyse the macroeconomic impacts, both an energy sectorial model and a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model have been used. During the year 2014 a carbon tax of 5 US$/tCO2e was approved in Chile. This tax and its increases (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 US$/tCO2e) are evaluated in this article. The results show that the effectiveness of this policy depends on some variables which are not controlled by policy makers, for example, non-conventional renewable energy investment cost projections, natural gas prices, and the feasibility of exploiting hydroelectric resources. For a carbon tax of 20 US$/tCO2e, the average annual emission reduction would be between 1.1 and 9.1 million tCO2e. However, the price of the electricity would increase between 8.3 and 9.6 US$/MWh. This price shock would decrease the annual GDP growth rate by a maximum amount of 0.13%. This article compares this energy policy with others such as the introduction of non-conventional renewable energy sources and a sectorial cap.
