    "abstract": "Climate-influenced changes in fire regimes in northern temperate and boreal regions will have both ecological and economic ramifications. We examine possible future wildfire area burned and suppression costs using a recently compiled historical (i.e., 1980-2009) fire management cost database for Canada and several Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate projections. Area burned was modelled as a function of a climate moisture index (CMI), and fire suppression costs then estimated as a function of area burned. Future estimates of area burned were generated from projections of the CMI under two emissions pathways for four General Circulation Models (GCMs); these estimates were constrained to ecologically reasonable values by incorporating a minimum fire return interval of 20 years. Total average annual national fire management costs are projected to increase to just under $1 billion (a 60% real increase from the 1980-2009 period) under the low greenhouse gas emissions pathway and $1.4 billion (119% real increase from the base period) under the high emissions pathway by the end of the century. For many provinces, annual costs that are currently considered extreme (i.e., occur once every ten years) are projected to become commonplace (i.e., occur once every two years or more often) as the century progresses. It is highly likely that evaluations of current wildland fire management paradigms will be necessary to avoid drastic and untenable cost increases as the century progresses.",

Winter conditions identified include a significant temperature decrease over the period and some years of extreme snowfall. Spatial variations in snow cover may be responsible for shifts in winter range. Indications are that summer climate has not varied significantly, but spring and summer conditions may not have been particularly favourable for plant productivity in the summer range of females and calves. Climatological observations more representative of the summer range are needed for a better understanding of ecological relationships there.",

This moment will live on in the memories of the participants. An innovative treaty, the Paris Agreement introduces a new technique to fight against climate change as well as a new combat logic. The innovations concerning the fight against global warming are bringing about evolutions in both treaty and environmental law. The Paris Agreement is of great architectural and normative complexity. In particular, it increases the scope of several principles of environmental law. For example, it is the first time that a universal multilateral agreement contains the concept of climate justice. Adopting a new logic of combating global warming, allows the Paris Agreement to highlight its specific dimensions. It can be considered as both a global agreement to renew our ambition of climate protection, while also being a dynamic agreement that reinforces this common climate ambition, to achieve our goal of limiting global warming to no more than 2 ° C.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in chemical, medical, cosmetic, and plastic producing industries have improved agricultural yields, health and human life in general. As a negative consequence, a plethora of chemicals are intentionally and unintentionally released to terrestrial and aquatic environments with sometimes devastating effects for entire ecosystems. One mitigation strategy to counteract this pollution is bioremediation. Bioremediation is an umbrella term for biologically mediated processes during which an undesired compound is transformed, degraded, sequestered and/or entirely removed from the ecosystem. Organisms across all domains of life may mediate bioremediation; yet, fungi are particularly promising candidates. They possess metabolic capabilities to break down complex molecules which make fungi the ultimate degraders of recalcitrant organic matter in nature. Bioremediation by fungi, also termed mycoremediation, has been more frequently investigated in terrestrial than aquatic ecosystems, although fungi also thrive in lacustrine and marine environments. Here, we focus on mycoremediation of emerging pollutants in aquatic environments. In this context, we draw parallels between terrestrial and aquatic fungal taxa, and their role in mycoremediation. We discuss the ability of fungi to break-down (i) pesticides, (ii) pharmaceuticals and personal care products, (iii) plastics, both conventional types and (iv) bioplastics, and fungal role, (v) mitigation of heavy metal pollution. Furthermore, we (vi) discuss possible mycoremediation strategies in applied settings and highlight novel enzyme based mycoremediation strategies.",

    "abstract": "The subtropical regions in China are prone to recurrent summer droughts induced by the Western Pacific Subtropical High-Pressure, which has induced the death of tens of millions of culms of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis (Carriere) J. Houzeau), a widely distributed giant bamboo with high economic and ecological values. In the future, the intensity and frequency of the summer drought are projected to increase in these areas due to global climate change, which may lead to significant age-specific mortality of Moso bamboo. So far, it is still unclear about the age-specific response mechanisms of hydraulic traits and carbon balance of Moso bamboo when it is suffering to an ongoing summer drought. This study aimed to investigate the hydraulic and photosynthetic responses of newly sprouted (1 year old) and established (2-5 years old) culms of Moso bamboo to summer drought, which was manipulated by throughfall reduction in Lin’an of Zhejiang. The results showed that both newly sprouted and established culms had a gradually weakening hydraulic conductivity and photosynthesis during the whole drought process. In the early stage of the manipulated drought, the established culms had more loss of hydraulic conductivity than the newly sprouted culms. However, the newly sprouted culms had significant more loss of hydraulic conductivity and lower photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance in the middle and late stages of the manipulated drought. The results suggest that the newly sprouted culms were more susceptible to summer drought than established culms due to the combined effects of hydraulic damage and photosynthetic restriction, explaining why the newly sprouted culms have higher mortality than elder culms when subjected to extreme drought. These findings provided insights into the mechanisms of Moso bamboo’s age-specific drought-induced mortality, which will help for the anti-drought management of bamboo.",

The tendencies of both ET and GPP were upward in the spring season, while they were weak and downward in the summer season. A complete factor analysis illustrated that the relative contributions of climatic change, CO2 fertilization, and management to the ET (GPP) trend were 56 (−32) %, −28 (25) %, and 68 (108) %, respectively. The decline of global radiation resulted from deteriorated aerosol and air pollution was the principal cause of GPP decline in summer, while air warming intensified the water cycle and advanced the plant productivity in the spring season. Generally, agronomic improvements were the principal drivers of crop productivity enhancement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 25.000 caves and house-caves exist between the provinces of Almería and Granada, most of them need to restore as per estimates of the Councils, taking part of the vernacular architecture of the region. These constructions, which some of them are millennial, are being referent to new projects and architectural models, as consequence of the climate change and the different energetic crisis of these last years. To the cave houses, as to any other building, they are required for their functional adequacy or rehabilitation that meet the basic requirements established by the” LOE”, Ley de Ordenación de la Edificación, to be considered a home. The realization of a study of the fulfillment of all the requirements for a cave house, would be an arduous task, given the diversity and complexity of these constructions, so this study only tries to analyze the process necessary for its legalization from the point of urbanistic as housing. The study has been focused in the province of Almeria, especially in the locality of Cuevas de Almanzora, that does not count with any specific regulation on caves and house-caves and per the estimates of the Council, it counts with approximately 800 units, very few rehabilitated and many pending rehabilitation and legalization as housing. Resumen Entre las provincias de Almería y Granada existen unas 25.000 cuevas y casas - cueva, muchas de ellas por rehabilitar según estimaciones de los ayuntamientos, formando parte de la arquitectura vernácula de la comarca. Estas construcciones, algunas de ellas milenarias, están siendo referentes para nuevos proyectos y modelos arquitectónicos, como consecuencia del cambio climático y de las distintas crisis energéticas de estos últimos años. A las casas - cuevas, como a cualquier otra edificación, se les exige para su adecuación funcional o rehabilitación que cumplan los requisitos básicos establecidos por la LOE, Ley de Ordenación de la Edificación, para poder ser considerada vivienda. La realización de un estudio del cumplimiento de todos los requisitos para una casa - cueva, sería una tarea ardua, dada la diversidad y complejidad de estas construcciones, por lo que este estudio solo trata de analizar el proceso necesario para su legalización desde el punto de vista urbanístico como vivienda. El estudio se ha centrado en la provincia de Almería, concretamente en la localidad de Cuevas del Almanzora, que no cuenta con ninguna regulación específica sobre cuevas ni casas-cueva, y que, según estimaciones del ayuntamiento cuenta con aproximadamente 800 unidades, muy pocas rehabilitadas y muchas pendientes de rehabilitación y de legalización como vivienda.",

    "abstract": "Peri-urbanization is often referred to as a transition zone following either an urban-rural gradient or an inner and outer peri-urban zone. Contrary to these notions and linked to its history in a former homeland, peri-urbanization in Mankweng appears as a complex and erratic process in reaction to shifting livelihoods, in-migration, and climate change. The process of ground truth for the study was designed by accommodating a combination of remote sensing images of WorldView-3 for the densely, vastly changing populated area (200 km2) and of Sentinel-2 for the overall study area of 400 km2. For the purpose of intensive data gathering, 16 plus three additional sites were selected in the area covered with the very high-resolution imagery as well as transect drives in the rural part. The study sites were selected and well distributed based on specific parameters such as building density, home garden size, road type with the goal of better interpreting what can be distinguished on the imagery and what influences land-based livelihoods. Additional information was gathered from informants during the ground truth through open questions and informal discussions. A solid knowledge of the land uses and land cover, including housing structures, agricultural practices, and challenges of land-based subsistence, was attained. The results revealed influential change drivers, settlement structure types, distinct development patterns, changes in traditional land-based livelihood specifically in terms of agriculture in the region and indicators for a functional zoning of the area. The ground truth provides a thorough basis for the object-based image analysis of the 200 km2 peri-urban area being next.",

    "abstract": "Energy and water have faced important levels of conflicts in the last 20–25 years in Chile. However, the way that they have been politically addressed in the last decade differs. These differences emerge from how these fields have been historically configurated, impacting on how the policy problems and policy options have been framed. Using thematic analysis of 93 interviews and documentary analysis, this article analyzes by contrasting two participatory processes which nourish the formulation of the energy and water policies in Chile in 2014–2015. It seeks to understand the factors that may influence why the development, impact and inclusion of new voices in public policies related to water and energy have been different, and how that can impact the water–energy nexus. Five factors emerge as determinants in this difference: structure of use, number of actors, governance and institutional framework, elite conformation, and legal framework. These factors impacted the policy processes and the scope of the policy outcomes, generating two different results: a long-term energy policy, and a water policy that did not survive the presidential period. Thus, the water–energy nexus is under pressure as a result of the tension between power structures, social responses to environmental issues and decision-making, environmental limitations, and climate change stressors, creating greater vulnerability and conflicts.",

    "abstract": "Along with global climate change, the occurrence of extreme droughts in recent years has had a serious impact on the Amazon region. Current studies on the driving factors of the 2005 and 2010 Amazon droughts has focused on the influence of precipitation, whereas the impacts of temperature and radiation have received less attention. This study aims to explore the climate-driven factors of Amazonian vegetation decline during the extreme droughts using vegetation index, precipitation, temperature and radiation datasets. First, time-lag effects of Amazonian vegetation responses to precipitation, radiation and temperature were analyzed. Then, a multiple linear regression model was established to estimate the contributions of climatic factors to vegetation greenness, from which the dominant climate-driving factors were determined. Finally, the climate-driven factors of Amazonian vegetation greenness decline during the 2005 and 2010 extreme droughts were explored. The results showed that (i) in the Amazon vegetation greenness responded to precipitation, radiation and temperature, with apparent time lags for most averaging interval periods associated with vegetation index responses of 0-4, 0-9 and 0-6 months, respectively; (ii) on average, the three climatic factors without time lags explained 27.28±21.73% (mean±1 SD) of vegetation index variation in the Amazon basin, and this value increased by 12.22% and reached 39.50±27.85% when time lags were considered; (iii) vegetation greenness in this region in non-drought years was primarily affected by precipitation and shortwave radiation, and these two factors altogether accounted for 93.47% of the total explanation; and (iv) in the common epicenter of the two droughts, pixels with a significant variation in precipitation, radiation and temperature accounted for 36.68%, 40.07% and 10.40%, respectively, of all pixels showing a significant decrease in vegetation index in 2005, and 15.69%, 2.01% and 45.25% in 2010, respectively. Overall, vegetation greenness declines during the 2005 and 2010 extreme droughts were adversely influenced by precipitation, radiation and temperature; this study provides evidence of the influence of multiple climatic factors on vegetation during the 2005 and 2010 Amazon droughts.",
