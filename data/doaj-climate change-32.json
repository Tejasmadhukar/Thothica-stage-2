    "abstract": "Globalization breeds increasing competition. In today’s dynamic climate, lean thinking has been found a promising business continuous improvement strategy for improving quality while reducing product cost and delivery time. However, its implementation has dynamic nature of challenges that varies from industry to industry and country to country, necessitating a specific framework by taking all stakeholders onboard. This study aims to propose a lean implementation framework to reduce defects and waste to improve the performance of the metal casting industry. The structure of the framework has been divided into three phases namely the lean conception phase, lean implementation phase, and lean sustainability phase. The proposed framework integrates the six sigma DMAIC methodology with lean tools and techniques to reduce defects and achieve performance improvement. A solid cast software has been used as a computer-assisted casting simulation tool to perform the analysis of defects within the casting. Further, the proposed framework is demonstrated and validated by employing a real-time case study that was manufactured using the sand casting process. The obtained results show remarkable improvements in poured metal weight (33.3%), mold weight including gating system (40%), casting yield (24.56%, rejection rate (90%), and financial saving (24.63%). As a result of analysis of percentage improvements data, the proposed framework can provide the practitioners with a standard roadmap and motivate the casting industries to implement lean for performance improvement through organizational change. Through the effective application of the lean implementation framework, quality enhancement has been demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Future changes in land use and cover have important implications for agriculture, energy, water use, and climate. Estimates of future land use and land cover differ significantly across economic models as a result of differences in drivers, model structure, and model parameters; however, these models often rely on heuristics to determine model parameters. In this study, we demonstrate a more systematic and empirically based approach to estimating a few key parameters for an economic model of land use and land cover change, gcamland. Specifically, we generate a large set of model parameter perturbations for the selected parameters and run gcamland simulations with these parameter sets over the historical period in the United States to quantify land use and land cover, determine how well the model reproduces observations, and identify parameter combinations that best replicate observations, assuming other model parameters are fixed. We also test alternate methods for forming expectations about uncertain crop yields and prices, including adaptive, perfect, linear, and hybrid approaches. In particular, we estimate parameters for six parameters used in the formation of expectations and three of seven logit exponents for the USA only. We find that an adaptive expectation approach minimizes the error between simulated outputs and observations, with parameters that suggest that for most crops, landowners put a significant weight on previous information. Interestingly, for corn, where ethanol policies have led to a rapid growth in demand, the resulting parameters show that a larger weight is placed on more recent information. We examine the change in model parameters as the metric of model error changes, finding that the measure of model fitness affects the choice of parameter sets. Finally, we discuss how the methodology and results used in this study could be used for other regions or economic models to improve projections of future land use and land cover change.",

    "abstract": "As the birthplace of Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Lancang Rive, Source Region of Three Rivers (SRTR) is an important resource for fresh water supplement in China. SRTR also has very obvious ecological function which forms ecological security barrier for China's Qinghai-Tibet plateau. The inland lakes here play an important role for the water cycle in the plateau. The monitoring results were extracted with TM data from 1976 to 2009. The results show that from 1976 to 2009 the lakes' area in SRTR dropped first and then expanded with 2000 as sector. The lakes area was 6778 km2 in 2009, about 1.90% of the whole region, and increased than 1976 by 133.15 km2. Most of the large lakes above 80 km2 have the same change trend. The expanded lakes increased in number gradually, while the changes in the amplitude and time characteristics were different. From 1976 to 2000, the number of new lakes increased while died lakes dropped; and from 2000 to 2009 it is just on the contrary. In the study the index of lake change trend (ILCT) was adopted to contrast lake atrophy condition. With ILCT 24.55 there is an expansion trend for the lakes in SRTR during the last 35 years. The lakes with ILCT's absolute value greater than 1 were those merged with or disconnected from surrounding smaller lakes. Here the precipitation and snow melt are main supplies for the lakes. The change of lakes' area has well correlated with precipitation, and weak correlated with temperature from 1976 to 2009. But from 2000 to 2009, there has a strong correlation with precipitation, temperature. All these show from the side that the precipitation and snow melt are important factors to influence the lakes’ change. The lakes have the coordination function for the good ecological environment in the region. The conclusions from the study can provide references in response to climate change research and rational utilization of water resources in SRTR.",

    "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) plays a critical role in the water cycle and energy balance at global and regional scales. Large-scale LST estimates can be obtained from satellite observations and reanalysis data. In this study, we first investigate the long-term changes of LST during 2003–2017 on a per-pixel basis using three different datasets derived from (i) the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) onboard Aqua satellite, (ii) the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) also aboard Aqua, and (iii) the recently released ERA5-Land reanalysis data. It was found that the spatio-temporal patterns of these data agree very well. All three products globally showed an uptrend in the annual average LST during 2003–2017 but with considerable spatial variations. The strongest increase was found over the region north of 45° N, particularly over Asian Russia, whereas a slight decrease was observed over Australia. The regression analysis indicated that precipitation (P), incoming surface solar radiation (SW↓), and incoming surface longwave radiation (LW↓) can together explain the inter-annual LST variations over most regions, except over tropical forests, where the inter-annual LST variation is low. Spatially, the LST changes during 2003–2017 over the region north of 45° N were mainly influenced by LW↓, while P and SW↓ played a more important role over other regions. A detailed look at Asian Russia and the Amazon rainforest at a monthly time scale showed that warming in Asian Russia is dominated by LST increases in February–April, which are closely related with the simultaneously increasing LW↓ and clouds. Over the southern Amazon, the most apparent LST increase is found in the dry season (August–September), primarily affected by decreasing P. In addition, increasing SW↓ associated with decreasing atmospheric aerosols was another factor found to cause LST increases. This study shows a high level of consistency among LST trends derived from satellite and reanalysis products, thus providing more robust characteristics of the spatio-temporal LST changes during 2003–2017. Furthermore, the major climatic drivers of LST changes during 2003–2017 were identified over different regions, which might help us predict the LST in response to changing climate in the future.",

    "abstract": "Rivers in the Lake Victoria Basin support a multitude of ecosystem services, and the economies of the riparian countries (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi) rely on their discharge, but projections of their future discharges under various climate change scenarios are not available. Here, we apply Vector Autoregressive Moving Average models with eXogenous variables (VARMAX) statistical models to project hydrological discharge for 23 river catchments for the 2015−2100 period, under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs), namely RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. We show an intensification of future annual rainfall by 25% in the eastern and 5−10% in the western part of the basin. At higher emission scenarios, the October to December season receives more rainfall than the March to May season. Temperature projections show a substantial increase in the mean annual minimum temperature by 1.3−4.5 °C and warming in the colder season (June to September) by 1.7−2.9 °C under RCP 4.5 and 4.9 °C under RCP 8.5 by 2085. Variability in future river discharge ranges from 5−267%, increases with emission intensity, and is the highest in rivers in the southern and south eastern parts of the basin. The flow trajectories reveal no systematic trends but suggest marked inter-annual variation, primarily in the timing and magnitude of discharge peaks and lows. The projections imply the need for coordinated transboundary river management in the future.",

Effectively improving the stress response to temperature and salinity changes in corals to prevent bleaching is one of the important issues. This study initially explored the use of artificial polyunsaturated fatty acids to assess the ability of Briareum violacea to slow bleaching, enhance growth, stabilize larval development and reduce antistress factors (superoxide dismutase and catalase) when they were exposed to temperature and salinity stress. The salinities used in the experiment were 25, 30, 35 and 40 psu, and the temperatures were 20, 25 and 30 °C. It was divided into two parts: Experiment 1—Effects of temperature and salinity and feeding on digestive enzymes, reproduction and stress response of B. violacea; Experiment 2—Effects of temperature and salinity and feeding on the settlement and survival of larvae. The results showed that the feeding treatment group reduced the superoxide dismutase, catalase and mortality of corals under stress and significantly improved larval development and larval settlement.",

Here we summarize the progress made by April 2022, which includes substantial reductions in the amount of equipment we have needed to procure, the quantities of clinical waste sent for disposal, and the associated financial costs. We estimate that annually our project results in more than 247 kg of reusable equipment being diverted from clinical waste at our institution. It has been crucial to ensure that equipment is recycled to a standard which still provides students with a safe learning experience which closely simulates the real clinical environment. Meeting the ongoing demand for clinical equipment essential to the day to day running of the clinical skills laboratory has also required consistent work. However, through this project we have developed methods for reusing equipment in the clinical skills setting which overcome these challenges. The Standard Operating Procedures provided here are designed to enable other clinical skills centers to introduce similar initiatives, so that collectively we may work to reduce the environmental impact of clinical skills teaching. This project is part of a wider movement within Oxford Medical School to include sustainability as a cross-curricular theme, and provides students with firsthand experience of how their work setting can be adapted to reduce its environmental impact.",

Study focus: This study describes a generalised validation procedure that uses rainfall (P), streamflow (Q) and storage change data (from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment - TWSCGRACE) and land use information. For each sub-basin, bulk ET was computed using the water balance framework and compared to estimates by ET products. Inverse water balance computations were applied to infer the storage change estimates from each product (ΔS = P – Q - ETRS), which were compared to TWSCGRACE to assess their monthly scale performances. New hydrological insights for the region under study: All products performed very well on the annual basis (mean NSE > 0.96) and satisfactorily on the monthly scale (mean NSE > 0.65). Land use classifications from the Land Development Department were used to examine the ability of four candidates (CMRSET, MOD16A2, GLEAM V3.3b and ETMonitor) to provide ET estimates with correspondence to physical land use conditions. By also considering product resolutions and data accessibility, MOD16A2 was consensually shown to be the most promising product to be used for water resources management in Thailand. In addition to local applications, the outcomes emanate the potential for utilisation on the global scale which should be further investigated.",
