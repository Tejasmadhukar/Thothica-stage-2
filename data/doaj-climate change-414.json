    "abstract": "The increasing demand for energy on a global scale, as well as the social pressure related to counteracting the effects of climate change, has created favourable conditions for the transformation of energy sectors towards the possession of low-emission generation sources. This situation, however, requires investment actions in order to modernise the existing power and CHP (Combined Heat and Power) plants and construct new units. These issues, together with the climate and energy policy pursued by the European Union, are the main reasons for the emergence of various governmental mechanisms supporting the replacement of old coal power units with highly efficient cogeneration units based on gas turbines and other units. The support may take different forms. This article discusses two examples of mechanisms available on the Polish market, i.e., (i) the capacity market and (ii) promoting electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration in the form of individual cogeneration premium. The purpose and novelty of the analysis was to identify the pros and cons and the key parameters which determine the advantage of a given mechanism. Both these mechanisms have been characterised and then compared via the example of a planned cogeneration gas unit (an open cycle gas turbine—OCGT). This assessment was made using discount methods based on the FCFF (free cashflow to company) approach. The analysis did not bring forward an unequivocal answer as to the absolute advantage of any of the solutions, but it was able to point out significant problems related to their practical use.",

    "abstract": "Issues related to anthropogenic climate change such as global warming, fossil fuel emissions, and renewable energy have emerged as some of the most important and pertinent political questions today. While the role of the state in the Anthropocene has been explored in academia, there is a severe dearth of research on the relationship between climate change and nationalism, especially at the sub-state level. This paper builds on the concept of “green nationalism” among sub-state nationalist parties in European minority nations. Using a multimodal analysis of selected European Free Alliance (EFA) campaign posters from the past 30 years, the article explores an extensive “frame bridging” where minority nationalist political actors actively seek to link environmental issues to autonomy. Although there is an apparent continuity in minority nationalist support for green policies, earlier initiatives focused on preservation of local territory while EFA parties today frame climate change as a global challenge that requires local solutions, which only they can provide. The frame bridging between territorial belonging and progressive politics has lead to the emergence of an environmentally focused, minority nationalist agenda that advocates for autonomy in order to enact more ambitious green policies, or “green nationalism”. This shows that nationalism in the right ideological environment can be a foundation for climate action, as minority nationalist actors base their environmentally focused agenda to address the global climate crisis precisely on their nationalist ideology.",

However, little research has been directed towards understanding potential impacts of climate adaptation measures in other governmental sectors on cultural heritage. We provide a case study demonstrating that winter road salt, used to reduce ice related accidents, damages historical iron milestones. As the climate warms, road salt use will move north into areas where sites have been protected by contiguous winter snow cover. This will expose Artic/sub-Arctic cultural heritage, including Viking graves and Sami sites, to a new anthropogenic source of damage. Research and planning should therefore include the evaluation of secondary impacts when choosing climate adaptation strategies.",

After a frame analysis of text and imagery, a narration analysis was conducted. Our results provided evidence that crises were covered in different ways. For a distant news portal, it was an obvious option to use the bushfires in order to visualize climate change. In contrast, the bushfire–climate link has been a politicized subject in Australia for decades; hence, the exceptional bushfire season was also unable to get the issue on the agenda. Although the Australian news media in our sample strived to portray a crisis under control, when compared to the pandemic, it was not so effective. Therefore, localization is a major challenge for effective climate communication, where lessons from the pandemic, using more economic and social frames, could be helpful.",

Sorghum is the fifth most important cereal crop, providing several uses including human food, animal feed, bioenergy, or industrial applications. The crop has an excellent adaptation potential to different types of abiotic stresses, such as drought, high salinity, and high temperatures. However, it is susceptible to low temperatures compared with other monocotyledonous species. Here, we have reviewed and discussed some of the research results and advances that focused on the physiological, metabolic, and molecular mechanisms that determine sorghum cold tolerance to improve our understanding of the nature of such trait. Questions and opportunities for a comprehensive approach to clarify sorghum cold tolerance or susceptibility are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The city Ho Chi Minh (HCMC) is one of the largest cities in Vietnam with the most dramatically economic development rate. Along with the economic development, the urbanization process in this city is also taking place very fastly. Due to the rapid urbanization and development, the emission rate from the industry and transportation leads to the increase in the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) which has been worsening the climate change. Protecting forests and conducting afforestation so that CO2 is transformed to nutrition through photosynthetic conversion is one of the most effective ways to mitigate the effects of climate change. As a result, the accumulation of CO2 emissions has become a global concern. Vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide, helps to conserve the environment, produces oxygen, reduces noise, and helps to stabilize subsurface water. This paper highlights the results of ENVI software which was used to interpret remote sensing images and Arcgis to evaluate the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by vegetation in each administrative unit: district in HCMC and ward. According to the obtained results, the amount of CO2 absorbed in urban districts “District 1”, “District 3”, “District 4”, “District 5”, “Phu Nhuan District” is immensely low due to the high population density in the center of city. The population is mainly concentrated in the center districts but land area for vegetation is low. Regarding the suburban area, with mangrove forests, Can Gio District has the highest amount of CO2 absorbed of 35,894.075 tons/day and followed by Cu Chi District with 21,548.48 tons/day. It can be indicated that Can Gio and Cu Chi districts improtantly function like the greenhouse gas sinks for the whole HCMC. The success of this study could contribute to climate change mitigation and support in urban and land planning, as well as resettlement policies. Aside from that, CO2 emission and absorption assessment and evaluation in large–scale cities like HCMC has become a crucial, urgent, and practical issue nowadays.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Oman upwelling zone (OUZ) creates an unfavorable environment and a major biogeographic barrier for many coral reef species, such as giant clams, thus promoting and maintaining faunal differences among reefs on the east and west side of the Arabian Peninsula. We record the former existence of Tridacna in the Gulf of Oman and review its stratigraphic distribution in the Persian Gulf to provide new insights on the connectivity of coral reef habitats around southern Arabia under changing climate and ocean conditions. Fossil shells were carbon-14 dated and employed as sclerochronological proxy archives. This reveals that the Omani population represents a last glacial colonization event during the Marine Isotope Stage 3 interstadial under colder-than-present temperatures and variable upwelling intensity linked to Dansgaard-Oeschger climate oscillations. It was favored by temperatures just above the lower threshold for the habitat-forming reef coral communities and instability of the upwelling barrier. We conclude that the distribution of Tridacna in the northern Arabian Sea is generally limited by either strong upwelling or cool sea surface temperature under gradually changing climate conditions at the interglacial-glacial scale. Opportunities for dispersal and temporary colonization existed only when there was a simultaneous attenuation of both limiting factors due to high-frequency climate variability. The OUZ will unlikely become a future climate change refuge for giant clams because they will be exposed either to thermal stress by rapid anthropogenic Indian Ocean warming or to unfavorable upwelling conditions.",

    "abstract": "Climate services have been criticised in the past for their tendency to only disseminate results from climate research, rather than to seek to understand and tailor to the needs of their target audiences. Two surveys have been conducted within two projects, ISIpedia and CLIMAP, to assess users’ needs for climate and climate impacts information of all countries (with a foremost focus on West Africa) and for Senegal.The joint analysis of the results showed that climate and climate-impact information is very relevant for West African respondents’ activities but a number of barriers prevent existing climate services from fully fulfilling the role they could play in this respect. Consistently across both surveys, the respondents highlighted the irrelevance or the incompleteness of the information that current climate services provide, which is mostly related to the lack of high-resolution information or high uncertainties, as the biggest barriers. Both surveys showed that the lack of training to understand the provided information is also an important barrier, which calls for the organisation of capacity-building activities to ensure the uptake of the information by their target audiences.Overall, the survey responses demonstrated the importance of stakeholder engagement to ensure the usefulness of climate services in West Africa. In addition, appropriate integration of the existing climate services within the national contexts as well as their dissemination within the ecosystem of information portals and products appear to be essential to ensure their effectiveness.",

The aim of this study is to provide an insight on good practices dealing with cultural heritage when it comes to disaster risk management and climate change adaptation, aiming at increasing cultural heritage resilience of historical areas. To this aim, the paper applies the best practice research methodology for investigating cultural heritage resilience in historical areas through the codification and analysis of good practices collected from EU-funded projects. The results consist of more than 90 good practices reviewed and analyzed according to a set of criteria. The research findings, organized according to three main categories (i.e., institutional, structural/physical, social), contribute to emphasizing the importance of improving knowledge from already available good practices. Two main approaches have been highlighted in the discussion, according to the key role assigned to stakeholders, education, data, and technology. The results allow to take advantage of existing knowledge to support communities to increase resilience of cultural heritage in historical areas.",

    "abstract": "Replacing fossil fuels with cellulosic biofuels is a valuable component of reducing the drivers of climate change. This leads to a requirement to develop more productive bioenergy crops, such as Arundo donax with the aim of increasing above-ground biomass (AGB). However, direct measurement of AGB is time consuming, destructive, and labor-intensive. Phenotyping of plant height and biomass production is a bottleneck in genomics- and phenomics-assisted breeding. Here, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for remote sensing equipped with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) was tested for remote plant height and biomass determination in A. donax. Experiments were conducted on three A. donax ecotypes grown in well-watered and moderate drought stress conditions. A novel UAV-LiDAR data collection and processing workflow produced a dense three-dimensional (3D) point cloud for crop height estimation through a normalized digital surface model (DSM) that acts as a crop height model (CHM). Manual measurements of crop height and biomass were taken in parallel and compared to LiDAR CHM estimates. Stepwise multiple regression was used to estimate biomass. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests and pairwise comparisons were used to determine differences between ecotypes and drought stress treatments. We found a significant relationship between the sensor readings and manually measured crop height and biomass, with determination coefficients of 0.73 and 0.71 for height and biomass, respectively. Differences in crop heights were detected more precisely from LiDAR estimates than from manual measurement. Crop biomass differences were also more evident in LiDAR estimates, suggesting differences in ecotypes’ productivity and tolerance to drought. Based on these results, application of the presented UAV-LiDAR workflow will provide new opportunities in assessing bioenergy crop morpho-physiological traits and in delivering improved genotypes for biorefining.",
