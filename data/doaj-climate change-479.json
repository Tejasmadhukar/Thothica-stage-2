    "abstract": "Several studies have reported farmers’ perceptions of climate change, but there is inadequate knowledge available on the farm households’ climate change awareness (CCA) in Pakistan. This study was undertaken to assess farmers’ CCA. For this purpose, the study collected the data from southern and central Punjab, Pakistan, through a purposively multistage random sampling technique. Binary logit and odds ratio were used to analyse the data. The analysis of the study shows that the majority of respondents were aware of climate change but had differing perceptions of climate change. This research showed that 70.8% of farmers are aware of climate change and reported their awareness level on winter and summer rainfall and temperature, the growing season length (GSL) of crops, the sea level rise, and the causes of climate changes and conceptual understanding of it while persistently denying climate change. However, many farmers did not perceive decreasing winter (48%) and summer (31.2%) precipitation, the majority of the farmers could not perceive in the GSL of summer (63.2%) and winter (64.4%) crops, while few did not notice increased winter (36.4%) and summer (33.6%) temperature, respectively. Financial and non-financial factors such as education (1.16), experience (1.07), distance to markets (1.07), non-agricultural income (2.83), access to agricultural credit (0.29) and marketing of produce (6.10), access to extension services (3.87) and the number of adaptation strategies (1.30) were pointedly related to farm households’ CCA. These odds values in the parenthesis show that the likelihood of CCA increases/decreases as these determinants increase. Moreover, the results of the study show that CCA is a significant predictor of adaptation to climate change. Main adaptation strategies opted for by farmers include changing crop variety and type, changing planting dates, tree plantation, increasing/changing fertilizer, soil and water conservation, off-farm income and diversification. Further, the study finds that some farmers did not perceive climate change as it takes time to be visible, but they are aware of climate change. Therefore, there is a need to reshape the households’ perception of climate change and enhance farmers’ CCA through existing extension services.",

Schrankia costaestrigalis is a newly-reported potato pest in southern China. Early-warning monitoring of this insect pest could protect domestic agriculture as it has already caused regional yield reduction and/or quality decline in potato production. Our research aimed to confirm the potential geographical distributions (PGDs) of S. costaestrigalis in China under different climate scenarios using an optimal MaxEnt model, and to provide baseline data for preventing agricultural damage by S. costaestrigalis. Our findings indicated that the accuracy of the optimal MaxEnt model was better than the default-setting model, and the minimum temperature of the coldest month, precipitation of the driest month, precipitation of the coldest quarter, and the human influence index were the variables significantly affecting the PGDs of S. costaestrigalis. The highly- and moderately-suitable habitats of S. costaestrigalis were mainly located in eastern and southern China. The PGDs of S. costaestrigalis in China will decrease under climate change. The conversion of the highly- to moderately-suitable habitat will also be significant under climate change. The centroid of the suitable habitat area of S. costaestrigalis under the current climate showed a general tendency to move northeast and to the middle-high latitudes in the 2030s. The agricultural practice of plastic film mulching in potato fields will provide a favorable microclimate for S. costaestrigalis in the suitable areas. More attention should be paid to the early warning and monitoring of S. costaestrigalis in order to prevent its further spread in the main areas in China’s winter potato planting regions.",

    "abstract": "Clonal plants can form dense canopies in which plants of different genetic origin are competing for the uptake of essential resources. The competitive relationships among these clones are likely to be affected by extreme environmental conditions, such as prolonged drought spells, which are predicted to occur more frequently due to global climate change. This, in turn, may alter characteristics of the ecological system and its associated functioning.We hypothesized that the relative success of individual clones will depend on the size of the ramets as ramets with larger leaves and longer petioles (large ramets) were predicted to have a competitive advantage in terms of increased light interception over smaller-sized ramets. Under drier conditions the relative performances of genotypes were expected to change leading to a change in genotype ranking. We also hypothesized that increased genotypic and phenotypic diversity will increase stand performance and resistance to drought. These hypotheses and the mechanisms responsible for shifts in competitive relationships were investigated by subjecting genotypes of the important pasture legume Trifolium repens to competition with either genetically identical clones, genetically different but similarly sized clones, or genetically as well as morphologically different clones under well-watered and dry conditions.Competitive relationships were affected by ramet size with large genotypes outperforming small genotypes in diverse stands in terms of biomass production. However, large genotypes also produced relatively fewer ramets than small genotypes and could not benefit in terms of clonal reproduction from competing with smaller genotypes, indicating that evolutionary shifts in genotype composition will depend on whether ramet size or ramet number is under selection. In contrast to our hypotheses, diversity did not increase stand performance under different selection regimes and genotype ranking was hardly affected by soil moisture, indicating that increasing fluctuations in water availability result in few short-term effects on genotypic diversity in this stoloniferous grassland species. Communities dominated by stoloniferous herbs such as Trifolium repens may be relatively resilient to environmental change and to low levels of genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background A functional forest carbon measuring, reporting and verification (MRV) system to support climate change mitigation policies, such as REDD+, requires estimates of forest biomass carbon, as an input to estimate emissions. A combination of field inventory and remote sensing is expected to provide those data. By linking Landsat 8 and forest inventory data, we (1) developed linear mixed effects models for total living biomass (TLB) estimation as a function of spectral variables, (2) developed a 30 m resolution map of the total living carbon (TLC), and (3) estimated the total TLB stock of the study area. Inventory data consisted of tree measurements from 500 plots in 63 clusters in a 15,700 km2 study area, in miombo woodlands of Tanzania. The Landsat 8 data comprised two climate data record images covering the inventory area. Results We found a linear relationship between TLB and Landsat 8 derived spectral variables, and there was no clear evidence of spectral data saturation at higher biomass values. The root-mean-square error of the values predicted by the linear model linking the TLB and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is equal to 44 t/ha (49 % of the mean value). The estimated TLB for the study area was 140 Mt, with a mean TLB density of 81 t/ha, and a 95 % confidence interval of 74–88 t/ha. We mapped the distribution of TLC of the study area using the TLB model, where TLC was estimated at 47 % of TLB. Conclusion The low biomass in the miombo woodlands, and the absence of a spectral data saturation problem suggested that Landsat 8 derived NDVI is suitable auxiliary information for carbon monitoring in the context of REDD+, for low-biomass, open-canopy woodlands.",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: Climate change is on the rise due to continuous greenhouse gas emissions from anthropogenic activities ever since the industrial revolution. Changing weather conditions are likely to have consequences for horticulture. (2) Objective and Methods: A short literature review was conducted, gathering findings on climate change and the impacts on the yield and product quality of special crops. (3) Results: Global warming will result in elevated temperatures and CO2 concentrations in all seasons. Extreme weather events such as heat waves are also on the increase. In vegetables, physiological processes such as vernalization and winter chilling strongly rely on temperature. Therefore, heat stress may cause irregularities in yield production and planning the harvest. For fruit crops, frost poses a risk that is enhanced through climate change, as does a lack of chilling, as cold temperatures in the winter are required for flowering in the spring. Abiotic disorders in horticulture are also related to changing temperatures and humidity. The nutritional quality of special crops may be threatened by increasing rates of plant development and premature ripening at high temperatures. Quality traits such as sugars, acids, or antioxidant capacity may also shift as well. (4) Conclusions: Adapting to these new climate conditions means developing new climate-resilient varieties to maintain high production levels with superior quality. In this mini review, cultivation measures to mitigate adverse climate impacts are also discussed. Current developments and recent findings are presented, pointing out further steps toward adaptation and sustainable production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The need for representative and accurate climate data such as precipitation useful for drought monitoring has been rapidly increasing among policymakers and practitioners to tackle climate‐change‐induced drought events. Hence, the objective of this article is to evaluate the drought monitoring performance of global precipitation products for the three wet seasons and rainfall regions in Ethiopia. Drought indices were calculated using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at 3‐month timescale for Belg (March–May) and Autumn (September–November) seasons and at 4‐month timescale for the Kiremt (June–September) seasons. Data products were evaluated for their accuracy in representing drought magnitude, geographical coverage and frequency using quasi‐objective (visual inspection), and frequency and correlation analysis methods. The performance of gridded precipitation products was compared against the SPI value computed for 126 reference stations and the Ethiopian satellite‐gauge merged precipitation data. Precipitation products showed different levels of performance in representing the magnitude, frequency and geographical coverage of drought events for the three wet seasons and rainfall regions. None of the data products outperformed in representing the occurrence of drought for all three wet seasons and the corresponding three rainfall regions. However, the Ethiopian merged precipitation, Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) and Climate Hazard Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) precipitation products are relatively better than others. The study results generally indicate that no single data outperform the other precipitation products in representing the complex spatiotemporal characteristics of drought events in a mountainous region like Ethiopia.",

    "abstract": "The Qinling Mountains (QMs) are considered to be the division in geology, geochemistry, and physical geography between northern China and southern China. They have crucial effects on regional climate, especially on rainfall and temperature, and have shown great scientific relevance to climate change research in China. Using the observational daily and monthly rainfall and temperature data derived from meteorological and regional automatic stations—as well as the methods of correlation analysis, climate trend analysis, and Mann–Kendal and t tests—we revealed the spatiotemporal change characteristics of temperature and rainfall and their correlation with elevation, longitude, and latitude. The results show that the annual mean temperature (AMT) underwent a significant increasing trend in the QMs. The maximum AMT increase occurred in spring, and the minimum occurred in summer. Positive anomalies of annual mean rainfall amount (AMRA) occurred in the 1960s, 1980s, and 2010s, and negative anomalies occurred in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s. In the QMs, the amount of moderate rainfall (MR) occupied the maximum proportion and accounted for 27.9% of the AMRA, whereas the torrential rainfall (TR) occupied the minimum proportion and accounted for 12.8%. The AMRA amount significantly decreased by 130.1 mm from the 1980s to the 1990s and accounted for 13.5% of the measure in the 1980s. The AMT and AMRA showed consistent change trends with increases in elevation and latitude and showed the opposite trend as the longitude increased. The results offer a further understanding of the meteorological background of the QMs, helping us in further investigating the potential physical mechanisms that influence the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of temperature and rainfall in the QMs. This study will provide a scientific basis for rainfall and temperature forecasts, with relevance to local ecosystems, agriculture, soil erosion, and the prevention and mitigation of floods in the future.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the response of ecosystems to global climate change requires that multiple aspects of environmental change be considered simultaneously, however, it can be difficult to describe the relative importance of environmental metrics given their collinearity. Here, we present a novel framework for disentangling the complex ecological effects of environmental variability by documenting the emergent properties of eelgrass (Zostera marina) ecosystems across ∼225 km of the Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, representing gradients in temperature, light, sediment properties, and water motion, and evaluate the relative importance of different metrics characterizing these environmental conditions (e.g., means, extremes, variability on different time scales) for eelgrass bioindicators using lasso regression and commonality analysis. We found that eelgrass beds in areas that were warmer, shallower, and had low water motion had lower productivity and resilience relative to beds in deeper, cooler areas that were well flushed, and that higher temperatures lowered eelgrass tolerance to low-light conditions. There was significant variation in the importance of various metrics of temperature, light, and water motion across biological responses, demonstrating that different aspects of environmental change uniquely impact the cellular, physiological, and ecological processes underlying eelgrass productivity and resilience, and contribute synergistically to the observed ecosystem response. In particular, we identified the magnitude of temperature variability over daily and tidal cycles as an important determinant of eelgrass productivity. These results indicate that ecosystem responses are not fully resolved by analyses that only consider changes in mean conditions, and that the removal of collinear variables prior to analyses relating environmental metrics to biological change reduces the potential to detect important environmental effects. The framework we present can help to identify the conditions that promote high ecosystem function and resilience, which is necessary to inform nearshore conservation and management practices under global climate change.",

Based on 734 articles extracted from the Science Citation Index (SCI) Expanded database of the Web of Science, we provided the visualisation for the performance of contributors and trends in research content by using VOSviewer and Science of Science (Sci2). The results showed that the United States was the most productive country, followed by the United Kingdom and China. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had the largest number of publications, followed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of Bristol. In terms of disciplines, environmental science and meteorological and atmospheric science have contributed the most. By using cluster analysis of all keywords, four key research topics of CHGs were identified and reviewed: (1) emissions calculation, (2) physicochemical analysis of halocarbons, (3) evaluation of replacements, and (4) environmental impact. The change in research substances is closely related to the phase-out schedule of the Montreal Protocol. In terms of environmental impact, global warming has always been the most important research hotspot, whereas research on ozone-depleting substances and biological toxicity shows a gradually rising trend.",
