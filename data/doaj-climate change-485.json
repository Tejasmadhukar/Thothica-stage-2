    "abstract": "The high quantity of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which has been steadily increasing year after year, has had a significant influence, particularly on the environment, resulting in climate change and global warming. As a result, numerous approaches, like the Schiff bases, have reported extensive investigation into storing this gas. We synthesized four new Schiff bases containing the amlodipine medication and tested them as CO2, CH4 and H2 storage. In boiling methanol as a solvent, amlodipine reacts with (p-Chlorobenzaldehyde, p-hydroxy benzaldehyde, vanillin, terphthaldehyde) to generate COFs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were utilized to study the features of the surface for synthesized compounds. Schiff bases have surface areas, pore volumes cm3/g, and pore widths, according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) test. At temperature (313 K) and pressure (40 bars), the produced Schiff bases obtained reasonable CO2 (26.3 cm3/g) CH4 (30.1 cm3/g) and H2 (2.5 cm3/g) absorption values.",

    "abstract": "A new system was developed for measuring sulfur isotopes δ33S and δ34S from atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS or OCS) on small air samples of several liters, using a pre-concentration and gas chromatography – isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) method. Measurements of COS isotopes provide a tool for quantifying the COS budget, which will help towards better understanding climate feedback mechanisms. For a 4 liter sample at ambient COS mixing ratio, ~500 parts per trillion (ppt), we obtain a reproducibility error of 2.1 ‰ for δ33S and 0.4 ‰ for δ34S. After applying corrections, the uncertainty for an individual ambient air sample measurement is 3.3 ‰ for δ33S and 0.9 ‰ for δ34S. The ability to measure small samples allows application to a global-scale sampling program with limited logistical effort. To illustrate the application of this newly developed system, we present a timeseries of ambient air measurements, during the fall and winter of 2020 and 2021 in Utrecht, the Netherlands. The observed background values were δ33S = 1.0 ± 3.4 ‰ and δ34S = 15.5 ± 0.8 ‰ (VCDT). The maximum observed COS mixing ratios was 620 ppt, suggesting that the Netherlands receives little COS-containing anthropogenic emissions. We observed a change in COS mixing ratio and sometimes also δ34S with different air mass origin, as modelled with the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT) backward trajectory analyses. An increasing trend of 40 ppt was observed in the COS mixing ratio between fall and winter, which is consistent with the expected seasonal cycle in the Netherlands. Additionally, we present the results from samples taken inside a highway tunnel in Utrecht to characterize vehicle COS emissions and isotopic composition. The vehicle emissions were small, with a COS/CO2 ratio of 0.4 ppt/ppm; the isotopic signatures are depleted relatively to background atmospheric COS.",

However, little is known about the plant physiological response to climate change. Results Here, we select the Kobresia pygmaea, an important perennial Cyperaceae forage, to examine the physiological indices to temperature changes in different growing months. We determined the contents of malondialdehyde, proline, soluble sugars, superoxide dismutase, peroxidation, and catalase activity in leaves and roots of Kobresia pygmaea at 25℃, 10℃, 4℃ and 0℃ from June to September in 2020. The results showed that the content of osmotic adjustment substances in the leaves and roots of Kobresia pygmaea fluctuated greatly with experimental temperature in June and September. The superoxide dismutase activity in the leaves and roots of the four months changed significantly with temperatures. The peroxidation activity in the leaves was higher than that in the roots, while the catalase activity in leaves and roots fluctuates greatly during June, with a relative stable content in other months. Membership function analysis showed that higher temperatures were more harmful to plant leaves, and lower temperatures were more harmful to plant roots. The interaction of organs, growing season and stress temperature significantly affected the physiological indicators. Conclusions The physiological indicators of Kobresia pygmaea can actively respond to temperature changes, and high temperature can reduce the stress resistance Kobresia pygmaea. Our findings suggest that the Kobresia pygmaea has high adaptability to climate warming in the future.",

    "abstract": "The reliability of general circulation climate model (GCM) global air temperature projections is evaluated for the first time, by way of propagation of model calibration error. An extensive series of demonstrations show that GCM air temperature projections are just linear extrapolations of fractional greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. Linear projections are subject to linear propagation of error. A directly relevant GCM calibration metric is the annual average ±12.1% error in global annual average cloud fraction produced within CMIP5 climate models. This error is strongly pair-wise correlated across models, implying a source in deficient theory. The resulting long-wave cloud forcing (LWCF) error introduces an annual average ±4 Wm–2 uncertainty into the simulated tropospheric thermal energy flux. This annual ±4 Wm–2 simulation uncertainty is ±114 × larger than the annual average ∼0.035 Wm–2 change in tropospheric thermal energy flux produced by increasing GHG forcing since 1979. Tropospheric thermal energy flux is the determinant of global air temperature. Uncertainty in simulated tropospheric thermal energy flux imposes uncertainty on projected air temperature. Propagation of LWCF thermal energy flux error through the historically relevant 1988 projections of GISS Model II scenarios A, B, and C, the IPCC SRES scenarios CCC, B1, A1B, and A2, and the RCP scenarios of the 2013 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, uncovers a ±15 C uncertainty in air temperature at the end of a centennial-scale projection. Analogously large but previously unrecognized uncertainties must therefore exist in all the past and present air temperature projections and hindcasts of even advanced climate models. The unavoidable conclusion is that an anthropogenic air temperature signal cannot have been, nor presently can be, evidenced in climate observables.",

    "abstract": "Wildfire is the most common disturbance type in boreal forests and can trigger significant changes in forest composition. Waterlogging in peatlands determines the degree of tree cover and the depth of the burnt horizon associated with wildfires. However, interactions between peatland moisture, vegetation composition and flammability, and fire regime in forest and forested peatland in Eurasia remain largely unexplored, despite their huge extent in boreal regions. To address this knowledge gap, we reconstructed the Holocene fire regime, vegetation composition, and peatland hydrology at two sites located in predominantly light taiga (Pinus sylvestris Betula) with interspersed dark taiga communities (Pinus sibirica, Picea obovata, Abies sibirica) in western Siberia in the Tomsk Oblast, Russia. We found marked shifts in past water levels over the Holocene. The probability of fire occurrence and the intensification of fire frequency and severity increased at times of low water table (drier conditions), enhanced fuel dryness, and an intermediate dark-to-light taiga ratio. High water level, and thus wet peat surface conditions, prevented fires from spreading on peatland and surrounding forests. Deciduous trees (i.e. Betula) and Sphagnum were more abundant under wetter peatland conditions, and conifers and denser forests were more prevalent under drier peatland conditions. On a Holocene scale, severe fires were recorded between 7.5 and 4.5 ka with an increased proportion of dark taiga and fire avoiders (Pinus sibirica at Rybnaya and Abies sibirica at Ulukh–Chayakh) in a predominantly light taiga and fire-resister community characterised by Pinus sylvestris and lower local water level. Severe fires also occurred over the last 1.5 kyr and were associated with a declining abundance of dark taiga and fire avoiders, an expansion of fire invaders (Betula), and fluctuating water tables. These findings suggest that frequent, high-severity fires can lead to compositional and structural changes in forests when trees fail to reach reproductive maturity between fire events or where extensive forest gaps limit seed dispersal. This study also shows prolonged periods of synchronous fire activity across the sites, particularly during the early to mid-Holocene, suggesting a regional imprint of centennial- to millennial-scale Holocene climate variability on wildfire activity. Humans may have affected vegetation and fire from the Neolithic; however, increasing human presence in the region, particularly at the Ulukh–Chayakh Mire over the last 4 centuries, drastically enhanced ignitions compared to natural background levels. Frequent warm and dry spells predicted by climate change scenarios for Siberia in the future will enhance peatland drying and may convey a competitive advantage to conifer taxa. However, dry conditions will probably exacerbate the frequency and severity of wildfire, disrupt conifers' successional pathway, and accelerate shifts towards deciduous broadleaf tree cover. Furthermore, climate–disturbance–fire feedbacks will accelerate changes in the carbon balance of boreal peatlands and affect their overall future resilience to climate change.",

    "abstract": "This work deals with reconstructing firn layer thicknesses at the deposition time from the firn's observed thickness in ice cores, thus reconstructing the annual accumulation, yielding a timescale and an ice-core chronology. We employed a dynamic time warping algorithm to find an optimal, non-linear alignment between an H2O2 concentration data series from 98 m worth of ice cores of a borehole on the central ice divide of the Detroit Plateau, the Antarctic Peninsula, and an estimated local temperature time series. The viability and the physical reliability of the procedure are rooted in the robustness of the seasonal marker H2O2 in a high-accumulation context, which brought the entire borehole to within the operational life span of four Antarctic stations around the Antarctic Peninsula. The process was heavily based on numerical optimisation, producing a mathematically sound match between the two series to estimate the annual layering efficiently on the entire data section at once, being disposition-free. The results herein confirm a high annual accumulation rate of aN=2.8 m w.e./yr, which is of the same order of magnitude as and highly correlated with that of the Bruce Plateau and twice as large as that of the Gomez Plateau, 300 and 1200 km further south, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The rapid intensification of drought, commonly known as flash drought, has recently drawn widespread attention from researchers. However, how the characteristics and drivers, as well as the ecological impacts of rapidly intensified droughts, differ from those of slowly intensified ones still remains unclear over the globe. To this end, we defined three types of droughts based on the root zone soil moisture (RZSM) decline rates, flash droughts, general droughts, and creep droughts, and then implemented a comparative analysis between them across the globe and the 26 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Extremes (IPCC-SREX) regions. The ensemble of RZSM from multiple reanalysis datasets was used to reduce the uncertainties. According to the frequency analysis, our findings suggest that flash droughts contributed to the majority of drought events during 1980–2019, indicating the prevalence of rapid transition from an energy-limited to a water-limited condition in most of the regions. The comparative results of vegetation responses show that flash droughts are more likely to happen in the growing season, leading to faster but relatively minor vegetation deterioration compared to the slowly intensified ones. By analyzing the precipitation and temperature anomalies in the month of drought onset, we found the role of temperature (precipitation) on drought intensification can be generalized as the warmer (drier) the climate is or the faster the drought intensifies, but the main driving forces vary by region. Unlike temperature dominating in midwestern Eurasia and northern high latitudes, precipitation plays a prominent role in the monsoon regions. However, the temperature is expected to be the decisive driver in the warming future, given its monotonically increased contribution over the past four decades.",

    "abstract": "Rice production in China has more than tripled in the past five decades mainly due to increased grain yield rather than increased planting area. This increase has come from the development of high-yielding varieties and improved crop management practices such as nitrogen fertilization and irrigation. However, yield stagnation of rice has been observed in the past ten years in China. As its population rises, China will need to produce about 20% more rice by 2030 in order to meet its domestic needs if rice consumption per capita stays at the current level. This is not an easy task because several trends and problems in the Chinese rice production system constrain the sustainable increase in total rice production. Key trends include a decline in arable land, increasing water scarcity, global climate change, labor shortages, and increasing consumer demand for high-quality rice (which often comes from low-yielding varieties). The major problems confronting rice production in China are narrow genetic background, overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, breakdown of irrigation infrastructure, oversimplified crop management, and a weak extension system. Despite these challenges, good research strategies can drive increased rice production in China. These include the development of new rice varieties with high yield potential, improvement of resistances to major diseases and insects, and to major abiotic stresses such as drought and heat, and the establishment of integrated crop management. We believe that a sustainable increase in rice production is achievable in China with the development of new technology through rice research.",
