    "abstract": "Poland, like other countries in the world, increasingly experiences the ongoing climate change. However, the level of preparation of the country and its society for climate change in the second decade of the 21st century can be evaluated as low. The Municipal Adaptation Plans (MAPs) created in 2017–2019 became a subject of research studies whose main goal was to determine the typology of adaptation actions to be undertaken as part of MAPs in the 14 selected Polish cities in various geographical regions. Moreover, the type and scope of intended actions were analysed according to the planned amount of expenditure and from the perspective of sectors. The tasks accepted for implementation up to 2030 mainly relate to modernisation and development of transport systems and to actions connected with physical infrastructure. A large number of tasks and even a bigger scale of financial sources planned in the analysed MAPs for mitigation actions show that Polish cities are at an initial stage of actions for climate protection. The typology of adaptation actions which the work proposes may be helpful in research carried out in countries of a similar level of preparation for adaptation to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to identify in situ the mechanisms underpinning the response of harmful algae to climate change demand frequent observations in dynamic and often difficult to access marine and freshwater environments. Increasingly, resource managers and researchers are looking to fill this data gap using unmanned systems. In this study we integrated the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) into an autonomous platform to provide near real-time surveillance of harmful algae and the toxin domoic acid on the Washington State continental shelf over a three-year period (2016–2018). The ESP mooring design accommodated the necessary subsystems to sustain ESP operations, supporting deployment durations of up to 7.5 weeks. The combination of ESP observations and a suite of contextual measurements from the ESP mooring and a nearby surface buoy permitted an investigation into toxic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. bloom dynamics. Preliminary findings suggest a connection between bloom formation and nutrient availability that is modulated by wind-forced coastal-trapped waves. In addition, high concentrations of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and elevated levels of domoic acid observed at the ESP mooring location were not necessarily associated with the advection of water from known bloom initiation sites. Such insights, made possible by this autonomous technology, enable the formulation of testable hypotheses on climate-driven changes in HAB dynamics that can be investigated during future deployments.",

    "abstract": "California’s San Joaquin Valley is both drought-prone and water-scarce but relies on high-intensity agriculture as its primary economy. Climate change adaptation strategies for high-intensity agriculture require reliable and highly resolved land use classification data to accurately account for changes in crop water demand, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and farmgate revenue. Understanding direct and indirect economic impacts from potential changes to high-intensity agriculture to reduce groundwater overdrafts, such as reductions in the cultivated area or switching to less water-intensive crops, is unachievable if land use data are too coarse and inconsistent or misclassified. This study quantified the revenue, crop water requirement, and GHG emission discrepancies resulting from land use misclassification in the United States’ most complex agricultural region, California’s San Joaquin Valley. By comparing three commonly used land use classification datasets—CropScape, Land IQ, and Kern County Agriculture—this study found that CropScape led to considerable revenue and crop water requirement discrepancies compared to other sources. Crop misclassification across all datasets resulted in an underestimation of GHG emissions. The total revenue discrepancies of misclassified crops by area for the 2016 dataset comparisons result in underestimations by CropScape of around USD 3 billion and overestimation by LIQ and Kern Ag of USD 72 million. Reducing crop misclassification discrepancies is essential for crafting climate resilience strategies, especially for California, which generates USD 50 billion in annual agricultural revenue, faces increasing water scarcity, and aims to reach carbon neutrality by 2045. Additional investments are needed to produce spatial land use data that are highly resolved and locally validated, especially in high-intensity agriculture regions dominated by specialty crops with unique characteristics not well suited to national mapping efforts.",

The weight of each climate model is obtained by weighting the current day observed data under the posterior distribution admitted under competing climate models. We use a linear model to describe the model output and observations. The approach accounts for uncertainty in model bias, trend and internal variability, including error in the observations used. Our framework is general, requires very little problem-specific input, and works well with default priors. We carry out cross-validation checks that confirm that the method produces the correct coverage.",

    "abstract": "Evaporation from a precipitation gauge can cause errors in the amount of measured precipitation. For automated weighing-bucket gauges, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) suggests the use of evaporative suppressants and frequent observations to limit these biases. However, the use of evaporation suppressants is not always feasible due to environmental hazards and the added cost of maintenance, transport, and disposal of the gauge additive. In addition, research has suggested that evaporation prior to precipitation may affect precipitation measurements from auto-recording gauges operating at sub-hourly frequencies. For further evaluation, a field campaign was conducted to monitor evaporation and its impacts on the quality of precipitation measurements from gauges used at U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) stations. Two Geonor gauges were collocated, with one gauge using an evaporative suppressant (referred to as Geonor-NonEvap) and the other with no suppressant (referred to as Geonor-Evap) to evaluate evaporative losses and evaporation biases on precipitation measurements. From June to August, evaporative losses from the Geonor-Evap gauge exceeded accumulated precipitation, with an average loss of 0.12 mm h−1. The impact of evaporation on precipitation measurements was sensitive to the choice of calculation method. In general, the pairwise method that utilized a longer time series to smooth out sensor noise was more sensitive to gauge evaporation (−4.6% bias with respect to control) than the weighted-average method that calculated depth change over a smaller window (<+1% bias). These results indicate that while climate and gauge design affect gauge evaporation rates, computational methods also influence the magnitude of evaporation biases on precipitation measurements. This study can be used to advance quality insurance (QA) techniques used in other automated networks to mitigate the impact of evaporation biases on precipitation measurements.",

In response to climate change and the government's carbon neutrality, measures for energy reduction in WTF is an important issue along with water quality management, and simultaneously, diversification of renewable energy based on treatment facilities is essential. The energy independence and renewable energy utilization by facility capacity were analyzed based on sewage statistics (2019) and operation data of the National Sewage Information System. The amount of energy consumed by WTF was analyzed to be 83.6 million TOE, and the renewable energy produced was 10.8 million TOE. In consequence of analysis, the energy independence of domestic WTF in Korea was 12.9%. Among renewable energy, the contribution of biogas was the highest at 83.6%, but the current status of energy independence is somewhat insufficient to energy independence plan of WTF, requiring support for alternatives and policies to produce and secure additional renewable energy. In order to increase and diversify the use of renewable energy, the integrated digestion biogas of organic waste resources, the use of cooling and heating energy based on sewage heat, and the development of salinity gradient power generation were reviewed. Based on this, it was intended to contribute to the preparation of measures to achieve carbon neutrality in sewage treatment facilities.",

    "abstract": "Conjugated and unconjugated pteridines and their derivatives are important cofactors in cellular metabolism. Hence, the amount of unconjugated pteridines in biological fluids has been found to be modified as a result of several disorders. It is necessary to note that while for the control of pteridines in urine samples there are numerous reference data, the literature referred to for the analysis of these analytes in serum/plasma is scarce. In biological fluids, pteridines can exist in different oxidation states, and these compounds can be classified into two groups according to: (a) oxidized or aromatic pteridines and (b) reduced pteridines. Oxidized pteridines yield a strong fluorescence signal, whereas reduced pteridines present a low quantum yield of fluorescence. In order to enable the analysis of the reduced forms, several preoxidation procedures to generate aromatic rings have been established. Also, stabilization of the reduced forms by the addition of reducing agents has been widely reported. The objective of this paper is to show possibilities and different approaches in the analysis of pteridines in serum samples. We have mainly focused on the description of the current situation in the application of high-performance chromatography methods with fluorimetric detection.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. The highlands of the Ukrainian Carpathians belong to the territories with the highest concentration of rare species and coenotic diversity in Ukraine. Due to highland ecosystem transformation, a large number of populations and communities of rare species are under the threat of degradation and elimination. Climate change. At present, effective growth and development of plants begins 2–3 weeks earlier compared to the 1980–90s. Sharp seasonal distribution of precipitation causes negative changes in the highland water-body hydrology regime affecting freshwater populations of plankton crustaceans and amphibians. Demutative successions. During the first 10–20 years of the succession its influence on the structure and vitality of the majority of rare species populations is mostly positive, but 30–40 year-long demutations usually cause negative dynamics. Overgro­wing results in the simplification of spatial structure and fragmentation, as well as decreasing of population density, disappearing of rare species from the community structure. Active protection measures should be locally implemented in protected territories: traditional type of grazing, mowing, and shrub or tree cutting in the cases of protection of extremely rare phytocoenoses and populations. Anthropogenic impact. Intensive recreation pressure causes digressive changes in numerous communities, which are located along the popular tourist paths to the glacial lakes, mountain summits etc. Unfortunately, the systematic violation of the protection regime in the highland zone of the Ukrainian Carpathians is obvious nowadays. Gathering medicinal and ornamental species poses a serious threat. Uncontrolled increase in the number of recreants in the highland areas for the last 5 years has destroyed its aquatic ecosystems more than in the previous 30–40 years. Usage of vehicles for recreation purposes (4×4, quads and motorcycles) refers to significant destructive factors for highland ecosystems. Protection measures. Population conservation and revival of communities is usually possible under the condition of moderate and short-term anthropogenic pressure. The visiting regime of the most popular highland sites must be put under control immediately, while mass ascensions must be completely forbidden.",

    "abstract": "The health of coral reefs is declining from the effects of human activity and climate change. Mass coral bleaching is often triggered by elevated water temperature and excessive solar irradiance. Shading can reduce coral bleaching risk. Shading-based management interventions, such as whole-of-reef marine fogging, have been proposed as a conservation tool for periods when coral undergoes excessive thermal stress. This study examined the effect of intermittent shade (30% for 0, 4, or 24 h) on two coral species, Duncanopsammia axifuga and Turbinaria reniformis, held at either 26.4°C or 32.4°C for 18 days. Coral fragments were assessed for bleaching (relative mean intensity of grey, chlorophyll a, and symbiont density), photochemistry (PAM fluorometry), and antioxidant biomarkers (SOD and CAT). Shading responses were species-specific, with T. reniformis more responsive to shading than D. axifuga. Thirty per cent shading delayed bleaching up to three-degree heat weeks (DHW), and 24 h shade was more protective than 4 h shade. Shading suppressed catalase activity in T. reniformis. Overall, our results suggest that intermittently shading corals for 4 h can moderate light stress and slow bleaching in some corals and could improve the efficiency of active solar radiation management in marine ecosystems.",
