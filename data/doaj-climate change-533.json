    "abstract": "Sulla (Hedysarum coronarium L.) is a Mediterranean biannual anthelmintic forage. Due to its high productivity, nutraceutical value, and suitability for harsh environments, interest in this crop is growing. Under the current scenario of climate change and water scarcity, it is important to evaluate crop drought tolerance, especially for newly bred materials. Drought stress and well-watered conditions (50 vs. 80% of the field capacity) were applied in a pot experiment to compare responses of the widespread commercial variety Bellante with those of a recently released variety named ‘Centauro’, currently registered in the Italian national register of plant varieties but not yet available on the market. Compared to the well-watered treatment, drought-stressed plants showed lower values of fresh biomass (−69%), number of leaves (−68%), and root length (−49%). The Centauro cv. showed a different architecture to Bellante with more shoots (+43% P P = 0.08). These traits are possibly related to its superior palatability. Centauro also developed a higher root length (+70%, P < 0.05) across irrigation levels. Drought stress affected condensed tannin (CT) content. A significant genotype × environment interaction was found with Centauro displaying more (+50%) and less (−35%) CT than Bellante under drought stress and well-watered conditions, respectively. The higher constitutive root length density of Centauro may be exploited in breeding programs aimed at improving the root sink, given the role of this trait in resource acquisition capacity and root-derived ecosystem services.",

A green roof that utilizes the building roof as a green space can overcome the UHI effects. Green roof is also an efficient solution in the procurement of green spaces in crowded cities. In 2019, Semarang City Mayor released regulation No. 24 of 2019 concerning Green Building that makes the focus of Semarang City development is to improve the urban environment. This research area is in two road corridors of Semarang City, Pandanaran and Pemuda roads. This study aims to examine the application of green roofs in these two corridors. Several identifications were carried out, first identifying building characteristics, second identifying opportunities for applying green roof, and third identifying building area capable of applying green roof. Primary data collection through field observations and satellite imagery as well as through questionnaires to the community who conduct activities in two roads corridors. The results of this study are the total roof area of 96,484m2 from 30 buildings on Pandanaran road and 23 buildings on Pemuda road that can become new green spaces to overcome Urban Heat Island effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plant phenology will likely shift with climate change, but how temperature and/or moisture regimes will control phenological responses is not well understood. This is particularly true in Mediterranean climate ecosystems where the warmest temperatures and greatest moisture availability are seasonally asynchronous. We examined plant phenological responses at both the population and community levels to four climate treatments (control, warming, drought, and warming plus additional precipitation) embedded within three prairies across a 520 km latitudinal Mediterranean climate gradient within the Pacific Northwest, USA. At the population level, we monitored flowering and abundances in spring 2017 of eight range‐restricted focal species planted both within and north of their current ranges. At the community level, we used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measured from fall 2016 to summer 2018 to estimate peak live biomass, senescence, seasonal patterns, and growing season length. We found that warming exerted a stronger control than our moisture manipulations on phenology at both the population and community levels. Warming advanced flowering regardless of whether a species was within or beyond its current range. Importantly, many of our focal species had low abundances, particularly in the south, suggesting that establishment, in addition to phenological shifts, may be a strong constraint on their future viability. At the community level, warming advanced the date of peak biomass regardless of site or year. The date of senescence advanced regardless of year for the southern and central sites but only in 2018 for the northern site. Growing season length contracted due to warming at the southern and central sites (~3 weeks) but was unaffected at the northern site. Our results emphasize that future temperature changes may exert strong influence on the timing of a variety of plant phenological events, especially those events that occur when temperature is most limiting, even in seasonally water‐limited Mediterranean ecosystems.",

A society that respects itself, also respects the environment and must contribute to removing the effects that affect it. The results of the study indicate that the companies that have implemented environmental standards are in a small percentage of less than 30%, which urgently requires the introduction of mandatory environmental standards into the national legislation and their reporting in the financial statements depending on the impact of the activity carried out of society on the environment.",

It follows a unique and novel transdisciplinary approach in that it condenses the scientific literature to the most salient concepts in the fields of big data, digital twins, and remote sensing and support. As for big data applications, their main improvement to conventional flood management stems from the integration of different data streams to improve situational awareness. Digital twins not only help to improve the speed and quality of management decisions by visualizing complex data in a simple and accessible way during a disaster; they can also simulate the evolution of a disaster while taking into account the unique characteristics and conditions of a city, thereby acting as a critical element of an early warning system. Remote sensing and support with UAV solve the problem of physical and informational access to a disaster zone. In conclusion, the paper shows that smart solutions can be of great benefit for flood management, and that cities should strive to enhance existing infrastructure and processes with digital technologies.",

    "abstract": "Extreme weather phenomena have become more frequent and intense in recent decades in the context of climate change, and these include heat waves that affect both the atmosphere and seawater masses. In 2022, a summer marine heatwave (MHW) affected the entire Mediterranean Sea, and temperatures up to 5 °C above seasonal mean were reached in the Ligurian Sea in the NW part of the Mediterranean basin. In this scenario, the waters of the Port of Genoa (at the northern apex of the Ligurian Sea) distinguished themselves by maintaining lower temperatures than those of the open sea (a maximum gradient of −6.1 °C on 9 August 2022) after the passage of a fast-moving storm. In this study, the weather and sea parameters of the period (June–December 2022) are analysed to determine the phenomenon that caused the drop in temperatures in the water masses of the Port of Genoa. The sudden cooling of the water masses inside the port was caused by a heavy rainfall event in early August. Moreover, the isolation of the port water masses due to the weak dynamics of the period kept them stationary and locked inside the port. Seawater temperatures inside the port slowly rose again after the event, remaining cooler than outside temperatures throughout August (−0.3 °C on 31 August), reaching and exceeding outside temperatures on 3 September (26.4 °C), and remaining warmer until 3 November 2022 (21.5 °C).",

    "abstract": "Abstract We demonstrate a wide distribution and abundance of hybrids between the river species Ranunculus aquatilis, R. fluitans and R. kauffmannii with the still water species R. circinatus (Batrachium, Ranunculaceae) in rivers of two postglacial landscapes of East Europe, i.e., Lithuania and Central European Russia. The Batrachium species and hybrid diversity is higher in the rivers of Lithuania (4 species and 3 hybrids vs. 2 and 1) and represented mainly by western R. aquatilis, R. fluitans and their hybrids whereas in Central European Russia, the East European species R. kauffmannii and its hybrid are the only dominant forms. Hybrids make up about 3/4 of the studied individuals found in 3/4 of the studied river localities in Lithuania and 1/3 of the individuals found in 1/3 of the localities in Central European Russia. Such extensive hybridization in river Batrachium may have arisen due to the specificity of rivers as open-type ecosystems. It may have been intensified by the transformation of river ecosystems by human activities and the postglacial character of the studied landscapes combined with ongoing climate change. Almost all hybrids of R. aquatilis, R. fluitans and R. kauffmannii originated from unidirectional crossings in which R. circinatus acted as a pollen donor. Such crossings could be driven by higher frequency and abundance of R. circinatus populations as well as by some biological mechanisms. Two hybrids, R. circinatus × R. fluitans and R. circinatus × R. kauffmannii, were formally described as R. × redundans and R. × absconditus. We found a hybrid which most likely originated from additional crossing between R. aquatilis and R. circinatus × R. fluitans.",

    "abstract": "CO2 causes the global issues on climate change and global warming. The main sources of this gas are from energy consumption such as power plants and natural gas processing. The absorption technology with amine solution of 2-(Diethylamino)ethanol (DEAE) is a promising method to remove CO2 from these processes. To calculate the basic parameters such as diffusivity and the flow of fluids and to design the absorption equipment, the fundamental properties such as the density and the viscosity are needed to be measured. Therefore, the objective of this work is to measure the density and viscosity of the aqueous solution of DEAE over the entire concentration range from 0-1 mole fraction and the temperature ranging from 30-80 °C. The results present that the densities of DEAE decrease with an increase in mole fraction and temperature of solution. Also, the viscosities of all ranges of mole fraction of DEAE decrease as temperature increases. However, the viscosities increase with mole fraction of DEAE up to 0.4 and become lower. Furthermore, the correlations of the Redlich-Kister equation, the Wilson model, the Grunberg and Nissan equation and Chauhan polynomial equation have been applied to represent the results and to predict the data for the equipment design. Among them, the Redlich-Kister equation is the most suitable model to represent the results with the lowest percent average absolute deviation (%AAD) with 0.1590 % and 1.9413 % for density and viscosity.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is projected to trigger strong declines in the potential distribution of major tree species in Europe. While minor natives have moved into the spotlight as alternatives, their ecology is often poorly understood. We use an ensemble species distribution modelling approach on a set of promising native tree species to gain insights into their distribution potential under different climate change scenarios. Moreover, we identify the urgency and potential of altered species distributions in favor of minor natives by comparing the niche dynamics of five major native tree species with the set of six minor natives in a case study. Our models project stark range contractions and range shifts among major tree species, strongly amplified under high emission scenarios. Abies alba, Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica are affected the strongest. While also experiencing range shifts, the minor European natives Castanea sativa, Sorbus torminalis, and Ulmus laevis all considerably expand their range potential across climate change scenarios. Accompanied by Carpinus betulus, with a stable range size, they hold the potential to substantially contribute to sustainably adapting European forest to climate change.",

    "abstract": "The Northern Hemisphere is experiencing amplified warming and greening; however, the responses of greening to warming remain unclear in terms of the cumulative and time-lag effects of climate factors. We chose Siberia, a hotspot in the Northern Hemisphere, as a study area and identified the relationships between the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and climate factors (e.g., surface temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation) during 2000–2016. In the growing season, the average cumulative duration of the vegetation response to climate factors was 3.6 ± 2.0 months, and the time-lag period was 1.5 ± 1.2 months, with the longest duration in forests and the shortest duration in tundra. Solar radiation was the dominant driver of vegetation greening in 56% of the study area, followed by temperature (41%) and precipitation (3%). In addition, the temporal effects of the climate factors were separated through partial correlation analysis; vegetation responded most rapidly to solar radiation variations with a cumulative duration of 2.2 ± 1.2 months and a time-lag period of 1.8 ± 0.8 months, followed by temperature (2.3 ± 1.3 and 1.9 ± 1.0 months, respectively). Precipitation showed the longest cumulative effect (3.7 ± 1.5 months) and the shortest time-lag effect (1.2 ± 1.1 months). Our results suggest that vegetation activity is influenced by both cumulative and time-lag effects. The temporal effects vary among the land cover categories, and complex ecosystems generally correspond to long-term temporal effects, and vice versa. Thus, the conversion of tundra to boreal forest due to warming in Siberia enhances the temporal effects of climate. These temporal effects could be incorporated into Earth system models to improve our understanding and monitoring of terrestrial ecosystems.",
