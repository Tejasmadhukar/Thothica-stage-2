    "abstract": "Abstract Rivers originating from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) provide water to more than 1 billion people living downstream. Almost 40% of the TP is currently underlain by permafrost, which serves as both an ice reserve and a flow barrier and is expected to degrade drastically in a warming climate. The hydrological impacts of permafrost thaw across the TP, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we quantify the permafrost change on the TP over 1980–2100 and evaluate its hydrological impacts using a physically‐based cryospheric‐hydrological model at a high spatial resolution. Using the ensemble mean of 38 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), the near‐surface permafrost area and the total ground ice storage are projected to decrease by 86.4% and 61.6% during 2020–2100 under a high‐emission scenario, respectively. The lowering of the permafrost table and removal of permafrost as a flow barrier would enhance infiltration and raise subsurface storage capacity. The diminished water supply from ground ice melt and enhanced subsurface storage capacity could jointly reduce annual runoff and lead to exacerbated regional water shortage when facing future droughts. If the most severe 10‐year drought in the historical period occurs again in the future, the annual river runoff will further decrease by 9.7% and 11.3% compared with the historical dry period due to vanishing cryosphere in the source area of Yellow and Yangtze River. Our findings highlight the importance to get prepared for the additional water shortage risks caused by pervasive permafrost thaw in future water resources management across the TP.",

    "abstract": "For over 20 years, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Earth System Model (MESM) has been used extensively for climate change research. The model is under continuous development with components being added and updated. To provide transparency in the model development, we perform a baseline evaluation by comparing model behavior and properties in the newest version to the previous model version. In particular, changes resulting from updates to the land surface model component and the input forcings used in historical simulations of climate change are investigated. We run an 1800-member ensemble of MESM historical climate simulations where the model parameters that set climate sensitivity, the rate of ocean heat uptake, and the net anthropogenic aerosol forcing are systematically varied. By comparing model output to observed patterns of surface temperature changes and the linear trend in the increase in ocean heat content, we derive probability distributions for the three model parameters. Furthermore, we run a 372-member ensemble of transient climate simulations where all model forcings are fixed and carbon dioxide concentrations are increased at the rate of 1 % year−1. From these runs, we derive response surfaces for transient climate response and thermosteric sea level rise as a function of climate sensitivity and ocean heat uptake. We show that the probability distributions shift towards higher climate sensitivities and weaker aerosol forcing when using the new model and that the climate response surfaces are relatively unchanged between model versions. Because the response surfaces are independent of the changes to the model forcings and similar between model versions with different land surface models, we suggest that the change in land surface model has limited impact on the temperature evolution in the model. Thus, we attribute the shifts in parameter estimates to the updated model forcings.",

    "abstract": "The risk of water erosion on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), a typical fragile ecological area, is increasing with climate change. A rainfall erosivity map is useful for understanding the spatiotemporal pattern of rainfall erosivity and identifying hot spots of soil erosion. This study generates an annual gridded rainfall erosivity dataset on a 0.25∘ grid for the TP in 1950–2020. The 1 min precipitation observations at 1787 weather stations for 7 years and 0.25∘ hourly European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) precipitation data for 71 years are employed in this study. Our results indicate that the ERA5-based estimates have a marked tendency to underestimate annual rainfall erosivity when compared to the station-based estimates, because of the systematic biases of ERA5 precipitation data including the large underestimation of the maximum contiguous 30 min peak intensity and relatively slight overestimation of event erosive precipitation amounts. The multiplier factor map over the TP, which was generated by the inverse distance-weighted method based on the relative changes between the available station-based annual rainfall erosivity grid values and the corresponding ERA5-based values, was employed to correct the ERA5-based annual rainfall erosivity and then reconstruct the annual rainfall erosivity dataset. The multiyear average correction coefficient over the TP between the station-based annual rainfall erosivity values and the newly released data is 0.67. In addition, the probability density and various quantile values of the new data are generally consistent with the station-based values. The data offer a view of large-scale spatiotemporal variability in the rainfall erosivity and address the growing need for information to predict rainfall-induced hazards over the TP. The dataset is available from the National Tibetan Plateau/Third Pole Environment Data Center (https://doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.271833; Chen, 2021).",

    "abstract": "Bangladesh, being a developing country, needs an uninterrupted electricity supply to sustain and expand economic growth. The government’s strategic vision of 2021 and the international commitment under the Paris Agreement has meant to attract new capital investments for renewable electricity generation by diversifying energy blends, ranging from natural gas to more reliable coal technologies and renewable energy. To understand the practical implementation of such policies, this paper explores the key factors of the renewable energy (RE) sector of Bangladesh. This research has adopted the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis method to examine the RE market and to understand the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) to attract new investments. For the analysis purposes, data were collected from extant literature and semi-structured interviews from the RE experts in Bangladesh. This study bears significance as it empirically reflects the government’s vision and strategy on RE development and analyzes its challenges and recommends accordingly. The analysis of the study reveals that the regulatory framework, tax haven/exemption, higher tariff, and presence of government guarantee are the major strengths to draw foreign investment. On the contrary, land acquisition, lack of coordination and collaboration among government authorities, administrative procedures, corruption, and access to local finance turns out to be the key weaknesses to consider while investing in this sector. In terms of the external factors, increasing energy demand, increasing global awareness of climate change, and decreasing cost of RE setup equipment act as potent opportunities; while the dominance of fossil fuel and discontinuity of energy policies should be taken as threats that can hinder the flow of investment in this sector. Hence, in order to attract sustainable FDI in the RE sector, several key areas need to be strengthened in the short, medium, and long-term. These are: (i) regulations on non-discriminatory treatment to foreign investors; (ii) control of corruption; (iii) protection of intellectual property rights; and (iv) coordination and collaboration between ministries.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is producing an increase on extreme weather events around the world such as flooding, drought and extreme ambient temperatures impacting animal production and animal welfare. At present, there is a lack of studies addressing the effects of climatic conditions associated with energy intake in finishing cattle in South American feed yards. Therefore, two experiments were conducted to assess the effects of environmental variables and level of metabolizable energy intake above maintenance requirements (MEI) on performance and carcass quality of steers. In each experiment (winter and summer), steers were fed with 1.85 or 2.72 times of their requirements of metabolizable energy of maintenance. A total of 24 crossbred steers per experiment were used and located in four pens (26.25 m2/head) equipped with a Calan Broadbent Feeding System. Animals were fed with the same diet within each season, varying the amount offered to adjust the MEI treatments. Mud depth, mud scores, tympanic temperature (TT), environmental variables, average daily gain, respiration rates and carcass characteristics plus three thermal comfort indices were collected. Data analysis considered a factorial arrangement (Season and MEI). In addition, a repeated measures analysis was performed for TT and respiration rate. Mean values of ambient temperature, solar radiation and comfort thermal indices were greater in the summer experiment as expected (P<0.005). The mean values of TT were higher in steers fed with higher MEI and also in the summer season. The average daily gain was greater during summer v. winter (1.10±0.11 v. 0.36±0.06) kg/day, also when steers were fed 2.72 v. 1.85 MEI level (0.89±0.12 v. 0.57±0.10) kg/day. In summer, respiration rate increased in 41.2% in the afternoon. In winter, muddy conditions increased with time of feeding, whereas wind speed and rainfall had significant effects on TT and average daily gain. We conclude that MEI and environmental variables have direct effects on the physiology and performance of steers, including TT and average daily gain, particularly during the winter. In addition, carcass characteristics were affected by season but not by the level of MEI. Finally, due to the high variability of data as well as the small number of animals assessed in these experiments, more studies on carcass characteristics under similar conditions are required.",

    "abstract": "The Paris Agreement signed in 2015 basically established the post-2020 international climate system. The agreement no longer emphasizes the differences between countries of the North and South. It requested each country to outline and communicate their post-2020 climate actions, which were legally termed as “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs). However, in the process of negotiating the implementation rules and regulations, there is still a big divide between developing and developed countries. Thus it is important to evaluate countries’ responsibilities, obligations and capacities for addressing climate change in the post-Paris era. By adopting the Delphi method, this paper establishes a more comprehensive index system to quantitatively evaluate countries’ capacities for addressing climate change, and to further identify and determine their capacities under the Paris Agreement. According to the evaluation results, there is still a large gap between developed and developing countries in their capacities for addressing climate change. Developing countries with weak capacities fall behind mainly in terms of the industrialization process, Human Development Index (HDI) and urbanization rate. Developed countries with strong capacities lack commitments and actions in terms of helping developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This paper, by expanding the use of the Delphi method with a multi-dimensional evaluation system that includes a historical responsibility index, attempts to provide a reference for differentiating countries’ capacities and responsibilities in global climate governance, and to promote a more equitable and reasonable global climate governance system.",

As a result, technological greenhouses are replacing traditional tin houses as locations for mushroom planting. These greenhouses feature several complex parameters. If we can reduce the complexity such greenhouses and improve the efficiency of their production management using intelligent schemes, technological greenhouses could become the expert assistants of farmers. In this paper, the main goal of the developed system is to measure the mushroom size and to count the amount of mushrooms. According to the results of each measurement, the growth rate of the mushrooms can be estimated. The proposed system also records the data of the mushrooms and broadcasts them to the mobile phone of the farmer. This improves the effectiveness of the production management. The proposed system is based on the convolutional neural network of deep learning, which is used to localize the mushrooms in the image. A positioning correction method is also proposed to modify the localization result. The experiments show that the proposed system has a good performance concerning the image measurement of mushrooms.",

    "abstract": "High-latitude wetlands are important for understanding climate change risks because these environments sink carbon dioxide and emit methane. However, fine-scale heterogeneity of wetland landscapes poses a serious challenge when generating regional-scale estimates of greenhouse gas fluxes from point observations. In order to reduce uncertainties at the regional scale, we mapped wetlands and water bodies in the taiga zone of The West Siberia Lowland (WSL) on a scene-by-scene basis using a supervised classification of Landsat imagery. Training data consist of high-resolution images and extensive field data collected at 28 test areas. The classification scheme aims at supporting methane inventory applications and includes seven wetland ecosystem types comprising nine wetland complexes distinguishable at the Landsat resolution. To merge typologies, mean relative areas of wetland ecosystems within each wetland complex type were estimated using high-resolution images. Accuracy assessment based on 1082 validation polygons of 10 × 10 pixel size indicated an overall map accuracy of 79 %. The total area of the WSL wetlands and water bodies was estimated to be 52.4 Mha or 4–12 % of the global wetland area. Ridge-hollow complexes prevail in WSL's taiga zone accounting for 33 % of the total wetland area, followed by pine bogs or “ryams” (23 %), ridge-hollow-lake complexes (16 %), open fens (8 %), palsa complexes (7 %), open bogs (5 %), patterned fens (4 %), and swamps (4 %). Various oligotrophic environments are dominant among wetland ecosystems, while poor fens cover only 14 % of the area. Because of the significant change in the wetland ecosystem coverage in comparison to previous studies, a considerable reevaluation of the total CH4 emissions from the entire region is expected. A new Landsat-based map of WSL's taiga wetlands provides a benchmark for validation of coarse-resolution global land cover products and wetland data sets in high latitudes.",

    "abstract": "Nearshore areas around the world contain a wide variety of archeological structures, including prehistoric remains submerged by sea level rise during the Holocene glacial retreat. While natural processes, such as erosion, rising sea level, and exceptional climatic events have always threatened the integrity of this submerged cultural heritage, the importance of protecting them is becoming increasingly critical with the expanding effects of global climate change and human activities. Aerial archaeology, as a non-invasive technique, contributes greatly to documentation of archaeological remains. In an underwater context, the difficulty of crossing the water column to reach the bottom and its potential archaeological information usually requires active remote-sensing technologies such as airborne LiDAR bathymetry or ship-borne acoustic soundings. More recently, airborne hyperspectral passive sensors have shown potential for accessing water-bottom information in shallow water environments. While hyperspectral imagery has been assessed in terrestrial continental archaeological contexts, this study brings new perspectives for documenting submerged archaeological structures using airborne hyperspectral remote sensing. Airborne hyperspectral data were recorded in the Visible Near Infra-Red (VNIR) spectral range (400–1000 nm) over the submerged megalithic site of Er Lannic (Morbihan, France). The method used to process these data included (i) visualization of submerged anomalous features using a minimum noise fraction transform, (ii) automatic detection of these features using Isolation Forest and the Reed–Xiaoli detector and (iii) morphological and spectral analysis of archaeological structures from water-depth and water-bottom reflectance derived from the inversion of a radiative transfer model of the water column. The results, compared to archaeological reference data collected from in-situ archaeological surveys, showed for the first time the potential of airborne hyperspectral imagery for archaeological mapping in complex shallow water environments.",
