    "abstract": "As a result of global increases in both temperature and specific humidity, heat stress is projected to intensify throughout the 21st century. Some of the regions most susceptible to dangerous heat and humidity combinations are also among the most densely populated. Consequently, there is the potential for widespread exposure to wet bulb temperatures that approach and in some cases exceed postulated theoretical limits of human tolerance by mid- to late-century. We project that by 2080 the relative frequency of present-day extreme wet bulb temperature events could rise by a factor of 100–250 (approximately double the frequency change projected for temperature alone) in the tropics and parts of the mid-latitudes, areas which are projected to contain approximately half the world’s population. In addition, population exposure to wet bulb temperatures that exceed recent deadly heat waves may increase by a factor of five to ten, with 150–750 million person-days of exposure to wet bulb temperatures above those seen in today’s most severe heat waves by 2070–2080. Under RCP 8.5, exposure to wet bulb temperatures above 35 °C—the theoretical limit for human tolerance—could exceed a million person-days per year by 2080. Limiting emissions to follow RCP 4.5 entirely eliminates exposure to that extreme threshold. Some of the most affected regions, especially Northeast India and coastal West Africa, currently have scarce cooling infrastructure, relatively low adaptive capacity, and rapidly growing populations. In the coming decades heat stress may prove to be one of the most widely experienced and directly dangerous aspects of climate change, posing a severe threat to human health, energy infrastructure, and outdoor activities ranging from agricultural production to military training.",

In this study, the input-output life cycle assessment (IO-LCA) is applied to estimate the direct and indirect impacts from the power generation sector for the years 2005 and 2010. Based on the input-output analysis, more than 90% of the total environmental impact of Thailandʼs power sector involves ten relevant sectors. Results reveal that the most significant environmental damage was on natural resources followed by human health, climate change, and ecosystem quality. The most dominant environmental impacts were non-renewable energy, global warming and respiratory inorganic effects. Furthermore, the power sector, which accounts for 80% and 61% of total each impact in 2010 respectively, had a large direct impact on climate change and human health. On the contrary, the coal and lignite, and metal ore sectors contributed significantly to indirect impacts on ecosystem quality and resources. Regarding the results, some additional suggestions can be made to improve current policies in Thailand, including the implementation of green manufacturing in the iron and steel production, and installing control devices in all power plant units. Consequently, IO-LCA can be applied to other industries for assessing their total environmental impacts, and planning CO2 mitigation strategies.",

    "abstract": "A simulation study was carried out to describe effects of climate change on cropgrowth and irrigation water demand for a wheat-maize cropping sequence in aMediterranean environment of Turkey. Climate change scenarios were projected using dataof the three general circulation modelsÃ¢Â€Â”GCMs (CGCM2, ECHAM4 and MRI)Ã¢Â€Â”for theperiod of 1990 to 2100 and one regional climate modelÃ¢Â€Â”RCMÃ¢Â€Â”for the period of 2070 to2079. Potential impacts of climate change based on GCMs data were estimated for the A2scenario in the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). The forcing data for theboundary condition of the RCM were given by the MRI model. Daily CGCM2 and RCMdata were used for computations of water balance and crop development. Predictionsderived from the models about changes in irrigation and crop growth in this study coveredthe period of 2070 to 2079 relative to the baseline period of 1994 to 2003. The effects ofclimate change on water demand and on wheat and maize yields were predicted using thedetailed crop growth subroutine of the SWAP (Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant) model. Precipitation was projected to decrease by about 163, 163 and 105 mm during the periodof 1990 to 2100 under the A2 scenario of the CGCM2, ECHAM4 and MRI models,respectively. The CGCM2, ECHAM4 and MRI models projected a temperature rise of 4.3,5.3 and 3.1 oC, respectively by 2100. An increase in temperature may result in a higherevaporative demand of the atmosphere. However, actual evapotranspiration (ETa) fromwheat cropland under a doubling CO2 concentration for the period of 2070 to 2079 wasSensors 2007, 7 2298 predicted to decrease by about 28 and 8% relative to the baseline period based on the CGCM2 and RCM data, respectively. According to these models, irrigation demand by wheat would be higher for the same period due to a decrease in precipitation. Both ETa and irrigation water for maize cropland were projected to decrease by 24 and 15% according to the CGCM2, and 28 and 22% according to the RCM, respectively. The temperature rise accelerated crop development but shortened the growing period by 24 days for wheat and 9 days for maize according to the CGCM2 data. The shortened growth duration with a higher temperature reduced the biomass accumulation of both crops regardless of CO2-fertilization effect. With the combined effect of CO2-fertilization and increased temperature, the CGCM2 and RCM projections resulted in an increase by 16 and 36% in grain yield of wheat and a decrease by about 25% and an increase by 3% in maize yield, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Accurate above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation across multiple spatial and temporal scales is essential for mitigating climate change and optimizing forest management strategies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of Sentinel optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in reliably estimating the plot-level total stem biomass (TSB), which constitutes the dominant material among the different tree components of AGB (stem, branches, and leaves). The study area was located in a dense coniferous forest characterized by an uneven-aged structure and intense topography. A random forest (RF) regression analysis was performed to develop TSB predictive models using Sentinel-1 and -2 images in an individual and combined manner. Consequently, three RF models were produced and evaluated for their predictive performance through the k-fold cross-validation (CV) method. The results showcased that the individual use of Sentinel-1 contributed to the production of the most accurate plot-level TSB estimates (i.e., coefficient of determination-R2 = 0.74, relative mean square error (RMSE) = 1.76 Mg/1000 m2, mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.48 Mg/1000 m2), compared to the use of Sentinel-2 data individually and the Sentinel-1 and -2 combination. In fact, the synergistic use of optical and SAR data led to the generation of an RF model that only marginally underperformed the SAR model (R2 = 0.73 and R2 = 0.72, respectively).",

    "abstract": "Soil organic carbon storage in agricultural soil constitutes a crucial potential for sustainable agricultural productivity and climate change mitigation. This paper aimed at assessing soil organic carbon stock and its distribution in three particle size fractions across five cropping systems located in Kiti sub-watershed in Benin. Soil samples were collected using a grid sampling method on four soil depth layers: 0–10, 10–20, 20–30 and 30–40 cm in five cropping systems maize–cotton relay cropping (MCRC), yam–maize intercropping (YMI), teak plantation (TP), 5-year fallow (5YF) and above 10-year fallow (Ab10YF) from July to August 2017. Soil organic carbon stock (C stock) was estimated for the different soil layers and particle-size fractionation of soil organic matter was performed considering three fractions. The fractions coarse particulate organic matter (cPOM: 250–2000 µm), fine particulate organic matter (fPOM: 53–250 µm) and non-particulate organic matter (NOM: −1, while cultivated land under tillage MCRC depicted the lowest, C stock 11.48 Mg C·ha−1. The three organic carbon fractions showed a significant variation across the cropping systems with the NOM fraction holding the largest contribution to total soil organic carbon for all the cropping systems, ranging between 3.40 and 7.99 g/kg. The cPOM and fPOM were the most influenced by cropping systems with the highest concentration observed in Ab10YF and 5YF. The findings provide insights for upscaling farm management practices towards sustainable agricultural systems with substantial potential for carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation.",

Representing this public usage through extraordinary new data on word frequencies in books published up to the year 2008, we show that a classic two-parameter social-diffusion model closely fits the comings and goings of many keywords over generational or longer time scales. We suggest that the fashions of word usage contributes an empirical, possibly regular, correlate to the impact of climate science on society.",

We reviewed the peer-reviewed, English-language literature between January 2005 and January 2018 for examples of documented human adaptation initiatives in Australia. Our results challenge previous assumptions that adaptation actions are not happening in Australia and describes adaptation processes that are underway. For the most part, actions can be described as preliminary or groundwork, with a particular focus on documenting stakeholder perspectives on climate change and attitudes towards adaptation, and modelling or scenario planning in the coastal zone, agriculture, and health sectors. Where concrete adaptations are reported, they are usually in the agricultural sector and are most common in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia’s food basket. The findings of the review advance our understanding of adaptation to climate change as a process and the need to consider different stages in the process when tracking adaptation.",

Here, we provide new evidence of the occurrence of low-tropospheric temperature inversions and associated uncertainties in their parameters existing among reanalyses produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and upper-air soundings for Europe covering the period 2001–2010. The reanalyses utilized here include (1) surface-input reanalyses represented by ERA-20C and CERA-20C as well as (2) full-input reanalyses represented by ERA-Interim and ERA5. The upper-air soundings were derived from the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA), version 2. The data consists mainly of air temperature and geopotential height from the model levels (ModLev) and pressure levels (PresLev) of ECMWF reanalyses. The results show that the frequency of surface-based inversions (SBI) and elevated inversions (EI) is largely in agreement among the reanalyses. The quality of their representation depends, however, on the inversion type, season, and region. Over the vast majority of IGRA upper-air stations, SBI frequency is overestimated and EI frequency is underestimated by ECMWF reanalyses. Substantially larger uncertainties arise from the selection between the data of ModLev and PresLev of the reanalyses—the differences in the frequency of the temperature inversions are particularly large for summertime SBI suggesting that PresLev are not capable of resolving the main features of shallow and weak SBI.",

    "abstract": "Farmers in the US are adopting a range of strategies to deal with climate change impacts, from changing planting dates to using advanced technologies. Studies on farmers’ adaptation in US agriculture focus on a variety of topics and provide an understanding of how farmers adapt to climate change impacts, which adaptation strategies offer better outcomes, and what challenges need to be addressed for effective adaptations. Nevertheless, we lack a comprehensive view of adaptation studies focusing on US farmers’ adaptations. A review of adaptation studies in US agriculture context will help us to understand current adaptation research trends and realize future research potential. To fulfill this gap, this study systematically reviewed peer-reviewed studies on adaptation to climate change in US agriculture. A systematic search on the Web of Science and Google Scholar platforms generated 95 articles for final review. These studies were categorized under five themes based on their topical relevance: (i) reporting on-farm adaptations, (ii) exploring potential adaptations, (iii) evaluating specific adaptations, (iv) challenges of adaptations, and (v) perceptions toward adaptations. A skewed distribution of studies under these themes has been observed; a majority of the studies focused on evaluating specific adaptations (47%) followed by exploring potential adaptations (22%), while reporting on-farm adaptations (17%), challenges of adaptations (6%), and perception towards adaptations (8%) received less attention. In this article, key findings under each theme are presented and some areas for future research focus are discussed. These findings indicate the need for more attention to documenting on-farm adaptation strategies and the associated challenges while emphasizing other themes.",
