    "abstract": "Recent climate studies of the South-Eastern Mediterranean indicate an increase in drought frequencies and decreasing water resources since the turn of the century. A four-phase methodology was developed for assessing above-ground biomass changes in shrublands caused by these recent trends. Firstly, we generalized the function SB = 0.008MAP1.54 describing the shrublands above-ground biomass (SB) dependence on mean annual precipitation (MAP) for areas of full shrub cover. Secondly, relationships between MAP and NDVI were formalized, allowing an estimation of precipitation levels from observed NDVI values (MAPNDVI). Thirdly, relative water-use efficiency (RWUE) was defined as the ratio between MAPNDVI and MAP. Finally, the function SBRWUE = 0.008MAP0.54 + RWUE was formalized, utilizing RWUE in estimating shrublands biomass. This methodology was implemented using Landsat TM images (1994 to 2011) for an area between the Judean Mountains and the deserts bordering them to the east and south. More than 50% of the study area revealed low biomass change (±0.2 kg/m2), compared with 30% of the woodlands of the Jerusalem Mountains, where biomass increased between 0.2 and 1.4 kg/m2 and with 50% of the semi-arid shrublands, where it decreased between 0.2 and 1.4 kg/m2. These results suggest that aridity lines in southern Israel are migrating northwards.",

The global climate model (GCMs) were developed by various institutions so each GCM has different GCM output. Then, the aim of this study is to evaluation the performance of GCMs for wind speed analysis in the area of Gulf of Thailand and Andaman Sea. In this study, the daily wind speed data was analyzed with a total of 15 GCMs and daily wind speed data of NCEP-NCAR was used as observation data to compare with wind speed data from GCMs over the period 1986-2005 (20 years). Moreover, the wind speed data was evaluated by efficiency coefficient which are root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). It was found tht MRI-CGCM3, GFDL-ESM2M, IPSL-CM5A-LR, and IPSL-CM5A-MR are consistent with the most of observation data from NCEP-NCAR.",

    "abstract": "Attributing the change in likelihood of extreme weather events, particularly those occurring at small spatiotemporal scales, to anthropogenic forcing is a key challenge in climate science. While a warmer world is associated with an increase in atmospheric moisture on a global scale, the impact on the magnitude of extreme precipitation episodes has substantial regional variability. Analysis of individual cases is important in understanding the extent of these changes on spatial scales relevant to stakeholders.Here, we present a probabilistic attribution analysis of the extreme precipitation that fell in large parts of the Netherlands on 28 July 2014. Using a step-by-step approach, we aim to identify changes in intensity and likelihood of such an event as a result of anthropogenic global warming while highlighting the challenges in performing robust event attribution on high-impact precipitation events that occur at small scales. A method based on extreme value theory is applied to observational data in addition to global and regional climate model ensembles that pass a robust model evaluation process. Results based on observations suggest a strong and significant increase in the intensity and frequency of a 2014-type event as a result of anthropogenic climate change but trends in the model ensembles used are considerably smaller. Our results are communicated alongside considerable uncertainty, highlighting the difficulty in attributing events of this nature. Application of our approach to convection-resolving models may produce a more robust attribution.",

    "abstract": "The global renewable energy landscape is changing rapidly. Green energies reduce greenhouse gas emissions, diversify the energy supply, and lower dependence on volatile and uncertain fossil fuel markets. The future looks promising for green energy sources, which are taking on an increasingly important role, especially in the current context, as governments are trying to identify viable solutions to the energy crisis and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Worldwide, there is a growing interest in and support for green energy sources, a factor that could help accelerate the current energy transition. Despite these positive developments, much remains to be done globally to make the energy transition a reality. In this respect, the European Union member states have committed to a wide neutrality target by establishing an increase in the total share of energy from renewable sources to 55% (by 2030) and, at the same time, reducing the net greenhouse gas effect emissions by at least 55% until 2030 to reach the neutrality target by 2050. Green energy sources are essential for long-term efforts to mitigate climate change and will play an important role in improving energy security and accessibility. The efforts of every country to strengthen the energy sector through the development of green energies will reduce geopolitical risks and disproportionate external costs for society. The large-scale use of green energies will contribute to sustainable development. The objective of our research is to review the literature on green energy in the context of sustainable development by analyzing research conducted by various authors and international organizations on these topics. The period considered for this study is 2011–2020. Our research focused on the EU 27, but the review also took into account the results obtained by other countries worldwide, such as China, the USA, Norway, and Iceland. The main research method used was the analysis of scientific papers, studies developed by international organizations, and a wide set of agreements and political commitments assumed by different states for developing green energy as a solution for sustainable development. The obtained results show an interesting international debate about green energies and how they can contribute to sustainable development. This paper’s results also show that in 2019 at the global level, low-carbon energy sources, including nuclear power and renewable energy, accounted for 15.7% of primary energy (solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal and wave and tidal), while in 2021, for the EU 27, the share of energy from renewable sources reached 22%. According to international statistics, more than 90% of the governments of many countries are making investments to efficiently capitalize on green energy sources and to design new models of sustainable economic and social development, in order to lower pollution levels, reduce the dependence on fossil fuel imports and limit the climate change impact.",

The paper was chosen because it is an example of traditional American journalism, which adheres to the principles of objectivity. As a result of the analysis, the following trend was found — throughout 2001-2005 years the newspaper actively presented two Arctic issues: the feasibility of oil drilling in Alaska and the problem of climate change in the Arctic. Since 2007, the arctic problematics on the pages of newspapers became relevant in the context of geopolitical issues, which was connected to the event of August 2, 2007, namely the setting of the Russian flag in the Arctic Ocean. Coverage of the Arctic issues was carried out in the context of competition, and later — international cooperation. In the period from 2011 to 2018, the focus of the American newspaper was pointed out to the climate change and resource development in the Arctic.",

Extant sites extended across five degrees latitude and ten degrees longitude, encompassed six subregions, traversed forty mountain ranges, spanned 2,378 m in elevation (1,631–4,009 m), and comprised three of five currently described pika subspecies. A climate envelope for extant sites using the PRISM climate model expands the range of temperature and precipitation values that have been previously described. Extirpated and old-sign sites were mostly found within the geographic and climatic space of extant sites, but often in warmer and drier portions. Considerable overlap of extirpated, old, and extant groups within the same climate space suggests that nonclimatic factors have also contributed to population losses. The broad distribution and enlarged climate envelope of extant pika sites indicate that despite some localized extirpations, pika populations are persisting across Great Basin mountains, and appear to be able to tolerate a broader set of habitat conditions than previously understood.",

    "abstract": "Ice cores provide unique archives of past climate and environmental changes based only on physical processes. Quantitative temperature reconstructions are essential for the comparison between ice core records and climate models. We give an overview of the methods that have been developed to reconstruct past local temperatures from deep ice cores and highlight several points that are relevant for future climate change. We first analyse the long term fluctuations of temperature as depicted in the long Antarctic record from EPICA Dome C. The long term imprint of obliquity changes in the EPICA Dome C record is highlighted and compared to simulations conducted with the ECBILT-CLIO intermediate complexity climate model. We discuss the comparison between the current interglacial period and the long interglacial corresponding to marine isotopic stage 11, ~400 kyr BP. Previous studies had focused on the role of precession and the thresholds required to induce glacial inceptions. We suggest that, due to the low eccentricity configuration of MIS 11 and the Holocene, the effect of precession on the incoming solar radiation is damped and that changes in obliquity must be taken into account. The EPICA Dome C alignment of terminations I and VI published in 2004 corresponds to a phasing of the obliquity signals. A conjunction of low obliquity and minimum northern hemisphere summer insolation is not found in the next tens of thousand years, supporting the idea of an unusually long interglacial ahead. As a second point relevant for future climate change, we discuss the magnitude and rate of change of past temperatures reconstructed from Greenland (NorthGRIP) and Antarctic (Dome C) ice cores. Past episodes of temperatures above the present-day values by up to 5°C are recorded at both locations during the penultimate interglacial period. The rate of polar warming simulated by coupled climate models forced by a CO2 increase of 1% per year is compared to ice-core-based temperature reconstructions. In Antarctica, the CO2-induced warming lies clearly beyond the natural rhythm of temperature fluctuations. In Greenland, the CO2-induced warming is as fast or faster than the most rapid temperature shifts of the last ice age. The magnitude of polar temperature change in response to a quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 is comparable to the magnitude of the polar temperature change from the Last Glacial Maximum to present-day. When forced by prescribed changes in ice sheet reconstructions and CO2 changes, climate models systematically underestimate the glacial-interglacial polar temperature change.",

    "abstract": "The impacts of changing climate on agriculture have consequences on livelihoods and food security. Smallholder farmers, who have heterogeneous farming systems and limited resources, compounded with multiple risks, are greatly affected. There has been limited research showing how vulnerability assessments have evolved in the smallholder agricultural sector of Africa overtime. This study systematically reviewed recent publications on vulnerability studies, especially among smallholder agricultural systems, to provide an overview of current developments in theory and practice of vulnerability in Africa over the last decade. The findings indicate an increase in vulnerability assessments undertaken across Sub Saharan Africa. Despite progress made in the application of enhanced conceptual frameworks and methods, at least four important gaps exist in the assessment process namely, inadequate engagement of local perspectives and knowledge, lack of clarity in the operationalisation of vulnerability, lack of comprehensiveness of measurement criteria employed and relevance of assessment in decision support. Notwithstanding these challenges, there exist opportunities to geographically improve assessments across Africa. In order to produce knowledge to traverse projected changes in climate systems for agricultural economies and to ensure sustainable smallholder livelihoods, we suggest that future research efforts should be oriented towards providing more information to enlighten science, policy and practice for informed decision-making and evidenced based policies. This requires evaluation of adaptation capacity as a critical aspect of vulnerability assessment to provide guidance and inform effective decision-making on allocation of scarce resources (prioritization); understand trade-offs management and implementation to build understanding among stakeholders that guide possible pathways to reduce vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "Drang Drung and Pensilungpa are neighbouring glaciers in the western Himalayas, sharing the same meteorological conditions and climate zone. The Drang Drung glacier is a clean glacier, whereas the Pensilungpa glacier is notable for its considerable accumulation of debris. The present study explores the topographical features of the Drang Drung and Pensilungpa glaciers and investigates how topography affects their response to climate change. Additionally, a comparison is made between these glaciers with others in the basin to assess their representativeness of the region. The study utilized Landsat Imagery and ASTER GDEM data from 1976 to 2020. The results revealed that the mean accumulation area ratio (AAR) for Drang Drung and Pensilungpa was 54% and 49%, respectively, during this period. Drang Drung has lost 8.16 km2 (10.73%) of its area, while Pensilungpa has lost 2.25 km2 (9.84%) of its area. The debris cover of Pensilungpa increased from 1.86 km2 in 1976 to 2.32 km2 in 2020, whereas the debris cover area of Drang Drung has increased comparatively more, from 4.01 km2 to 4.76 km2. Within the same time frame, the snowline altitude (SLA) shifted upward by an average of 104 m and 88 m for Drang Drung Pensilungpa, respectively. Further, our findings revealed a substantial connection between the size of glaciers and the speed at which their area is diminishing. The mean slope was identified as a key factor in influencing the rate at which the area is lost, and the retreat rates of the glaciers. The reduction in glacial area, increased debris coverage, and changes in SLA are key indicators of ice volume loss under prevailing climatic conditions. The present study recommends that long-term field-based data and the incorporation of multi-temporal satellite imagery are crucial to mitigate uncertainties in detecting changes in Himalayan glaciers. These approaches would contribute to a more accurate understanding of glacial changes, and would aid in forecasting future scenarios considering ongoing global warming trends.",
