    "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are critical to the hydrological cycle of the western United States with both favorable and formidable impacts to society based on their landfalling characteristics. In this study, we provide a first-of-its-kind evaluation of how landfalling ARs may respond to several stabilized warming scenarios. To do this we combine a recently developed AR detection workflow with an ensemble of uniform high-resolution (0.25°) Community Earth System Model simulations designed to facilitate detection and attribution of extreme events with global warming. These simulations include a world that might have been in the absence of anthropogenic warming (+0◦C), a world that corresponds to present day warming (+0.85◦C), and several future worlds corresponding to +1.5◦C, +2◦C and +3◦C global warming. We show that warming increases the number of water management relevant landfalling ARs from 19.1 ARs per year at +0◦C to 23.6 ARs per year at +3◦C. Additionally, this warming intensifies the amount of water transported by landfalling ARs resulting in a decrease in the fraction of ARs that are “mostly to primarily beneficial” to water resource management (i.e., 91% of ARs at +0◦C to 78% at +3◦C) and an increase in the fraction of ARs that are “mostly or primarily hazardous” to water resource management (i.e., 2% of ARs at +0◦C to 8% at +3◦C). Shifts in AR character also have important ramifications on flood damages, whereby for every +1◦C of additional warming from present conditions annual average flood damages increase by ~$1 billion. These findings highlight the pragmatic implications of climate mitigation aimed at limiting global warming to under +2◦C.",

    "abstract": "A range of future climate scenarios are projected for high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, given uncertainties over future human actions as well as potential environmental and climatic feedbacks. The geological record offers an opportunity to understand climate system response to a range of forcings and feedbacks which operate over multiple temporal and spatial scales. Here, we examine a single interglacial during the late Pliocene (KM5c, ca. 3.205±0.01 Ma) when atmospheric CO2 exceeded pre-industrial concentrations, but were similar to today and to the lowest emission scenarios for this century. As orbital forcing and continental configurations were almost identical to today, we are able to focus on equilibrium climate system response to modern and near-future CO2. Using proxy data from 32 sites, we demonstrate that global mean sea-surface temperatures were warmer than pre-industrial values, by ∼2.3 ∘C for the combined proxy data (foraminifera Mg∕Ca and alkenones), or by ∼3.2–3.4 ∘C (alkenones only). Compared to the pre-industrial period, reduced meridional gradients and enhanced warming in the North Atlantic are consistently reconstructed. There is broad agreement between data and models at the global scale, with regional differences reflecting ocean circulation and/or proxy signals. An uneven distribution of proxy data in time and space does, however, add uncertainty to our anomaly calculations. The reconstructed global mean sea-surface temperature anomaly for KM5c is warmer than all but three of the PlioMIP2 model outputs, and the reconstructed North Atlantic data tend to align with the warmest KM5c model values. Our results demonstrate that even under low-CO2 emission scenarios, surface ocean warming may be expected to exceed model projections and will be accentuated in the higher latitudes.",

    "abstract": "Energy is one of the most important social and economic infrastructures and human life is strongly depends on it. In recent years, the occurrence of natural disasters such as drought as a high-impact low-probability event is undeniable. So, energy planning in the disruption situation is necessary in order to anticipate and maintain the performance of the energy system in optimal condition. This paper focuses on developing a hybrid long-term framework for evaluating the energy system resilience based on sustainability concept against drought. The model bridges the gap between long-term energy system planning in macro level and short-term switching operations or micro level modeling​ approach in response to drought resulted by climate change. The new resilience indexes are used to maximize the social welfare, to minimize the energy needed but not supplied (ENNS), to recover the system performance rapidly and minimum the total cost of the energy system after occurring drought. When disaster happens, the modeling of energy systems will do through two stages because the behavior of the system should be considered, compare and analyzed before and after disruption events. On the other hand, the system uncertainties, possible futures and different strategies can change the optimal path of the energy needed supply, which is examined by scenario analysis in the proposed model. So, the developed model is a two-stage optimization model with linear programming approach and scenario analyzing model with a combination of back-casting and forward future approaches Numerical model is performed on UTOPIA energy system and its results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge about how species richness varies along spatial and environmental gradients is important for the conservation and use of biodiversity. The Ericaceae is a major component of alpine and subalpine vegetation globally. However, little is known about the spatial pattern of species richness and the factors that drive that richness in Ericaceae. We investigated variation in species richness of Ericaceae along an elevational gradient in Yunnan, China, and used a variation partitioning analysis based on redundancy analysis ordination to examine how those changes might be influenced by the mid-domain effect, the species-area relationship, and climatic variables. Species richness varied significantly with elevation, peaking in the upper third of the elevational gradient. Of the factors examined, climate explained a larger proportion of the variance in species richness along the elevational gradient than either land area or geometric constraints. Species richness showed a unimodal relationship with mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation. The elevational pattern of species richness for Ericaceae was shaped by the combined effects of climate and competition. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the potential effects of climate change on species richness for Ericaceae.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization is a rapid global trend, leading to consequences such as urban heat islands and local flooding. Imminent climate change is predicted to intensify these consequences, forcing cities to rethink common infrastructure practices. One popular method of adaptation is green infrastructure implementation, which has been found to reduce local temperatures and alleviate excess runoff when installed effectively. As cities continue to change and adapt, land use/landcover modeling becomes an important tool for city officials in planning future land usage. This study uses a combination of cellular automata, machine learning, and Markov chain analysis to predict high resolution land use/landcover changes in Philadelphia, PA, USA for the year 2036. The 2036 landcover model assumes full implementation of Philadelphia’s green infrastructure program and past temporal trends of urbanization. The methodology used to create the 2036 model was validated by creating an intermediate prediction of a 2015 landcover that was then compared to an existing 2015 landcover. The accuracy of the validation was determined using Kappa statistics and disagreement scores. The 2036 model successfully met Philadelphia’s green infrastructure goals. A variety of landscape metrics demonstrated an overall decrease in fragmentation throughout the landscape due to increases in urban landcover.",

A suitable combination of statistical methods and visualisation techniques allows the creation of outputs that support the interpretation and understanding as well as communication of the complex climate analysis to a wider target audience. The present paper describes the adopted approaches to portray information about climate change in Germany until the end of the 21st century in meaningful maps with the aim to communicate it to the public as well as decision makers. In particular, the conducted analyses focused on the assessment of climate regions, climate hotspots and climate analogues. The maps showing the resulting spatial patterns 1) divide the country in seven climate clusters, 2) reveal different hotspot areas of climate change in terms of key indicators for the middle and the end of the century and 3) provide current and future climate shifts of German cities to analogue regions in Europe. Results are accompanied with recommendations and interpretation aids supporting the correct use for practical applications and communication purposes. The final map products resulting from these analyses and published in the frame of the Climate Impact and Risk Assessment for Germany 2021 were taken up by different national media outlets (print and audio), education experts as well as stakeholders, showing benefits and limitations of the visualisation choices.",

    "abstract": "Many rural communities in the Lower Mekong region are vulnerable to the climate uncertainty induced by climate change due to high rate of poverty, lack of agricultural technology, and heavy reliance on the environment for their livelihoods. Rural people are likely to migrate to urban areas in response to the climate impacts and thanks to the rises in the number of cities, urban areas, and industrial zones in this region over the last decades. We selected a rural area in Cambodia to examine the link between climate impacts and rural out-migration because the majority of Cambodian territory is located in the Lower Mekong Basin which has experienced long-term climate change. Through an empirical study which consisted of an integrated quantitative and qualitative research approach in Kampong Cham province, we found the temperature showed a significant (α = 0.05) trend of +0.027C°/year, while rainfall showed a non-significative trend, but it had a marked inter-annual variability over the last two decades. The migration trend increased: most farmers' families of small and medium sized farms and who experienced more climate impacts had more family members who migrated. Migration is one of the solutions for farmers trying to maintain their livelihoods and incomes, but mass migration causes gaps in the agricultural and rural labour force. This study implies that enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity in agriculture will contribute to improving the migration landscape.",

    "abstract": "Plant diseases are a major cause of reduction in agricultural output, which leads to severe economic losses and unstable food supply. The citrus plant is an economically important fruit crop grown and produced worldwide. However, citrus plants are easily affected by various factors, such as climate change, pests, and diseases, resulting in reduced yield and quality. Advances in computer vision in recent years have been widely used for plant disease detection and classification, providing opportunities for early disease detection, and resulting in improvements in agriculture. Particularly, the early and accurate detection of citrus diseases, which are vulnerable to pests, is very important to prevent the spread of pests and reduce crop damage. Research on citrus pest disease is ongoing, but it is difficult to apply research results to cultivation owing to a lack of datasets for research and limited types of pests. In this study, we built a dataset by self-collecting a total of 20,000 citrus pest images, including fruits and leaves, from actual cultivation sites. The constructed dataset was trained, verified, and tested using a model that had undergone five transfer learning steps. All models used in the experiment had an average accuracy of 97% or more and an average f1 score of 96% or more. We built a web application server using the EfficientNet-b0 model, which exhibited the best performance among the five learning models. The built web application tested citrus pest disease using image samples collected from websites other than the self-collected image samples and prepared data, and both samples correctly classified the disease. The citrus pest automatic diagnosis web system using the model proposed in this study plays a useful auxiliary role in recognizing and classifying citrus diseases. This can, in turn, help improve the overall quality of citrus fruits.",

    "abstract": "Under the joint influence of climate change and human production and living activities on land and sea, the morphology and use function of the coastline have undergone notable changes, triggering more significant environmental and ecological effects. In this paper, we quantified the evolution characteristics of the coastline over the past 30 years and measured the possible environmental pollution and ecological degradation by means of spatiotemporal coupling analysis in terms of spatial form and land-use function. The Chinese Bohai Rim region was taken as an example, and the Google Earth Engine was applied to achieve a long time series of interannually continuous land use function classification of the coastal zone. The study shows that: (1) from 1987–2020, the coastline of Bohai Rim showed an overall trend of seaward expansion, with the length of the coastline increasing by 15.6%, most significantly from 2003 to 2011; (2) the proportion of construction function coastline increased from 14.66% to 42.8%, while the proportion of cropland coastline decreased from 52.01% to 18.16% during 2000–2020, with the natural ecological coastline decreasing in the early stage and recovering in the later stage, thus becoming more stable overall; (3) 82.73% of coastal districts and counties showed a linear correlation between changes in coastline function and water quality level, and 77.8% showed a consistent degree of change of coastline function and loss of ecological land, indicating that changes in the coastline have triggered significant problems in terms of environmental pollution and ecological degradation. With the exception of localized areas such as the Yellow River Delta, where coastline change is somewhat more significantly influenced by environmental climate change, most other coastline changes are primarily due to human land-based development; therefore, coastal policy constraints bring obvious mitigation.",

Les résultats de cette étude révèlent une diminution statistiquement significative des modules annuels que le test de Pettitt situe en 1972–1973, mais rien de tel pour les pluies à ce même pas de temps. Les écarts des moyennes décennales à la moyenne interannuelle montrent cependant des liens plus nets entre ces variables, se traduisant essentiellement par une diminution synchrone au cours des décennies 1970 et 1980. Cette diminution est suivie d'une reprise au cours des deux décennies d'après (1990 et 2000), laquelle s'estompe à nouveau au cours de la décennie 2010. Les écoulements des saisons pluvieuses (printemps et automne) ont enregistré les modifications les plus importantes, suite aux variations des régimes pluviométriques des saisons sèches (hiver et été) qui les précèdent. La saison sèche d'hiver a connu entre les décennies 1970–1990 une diminution importante des précipitations qui a provoquée une chute des écoulements du printemps. Le rehaussement et la flexion respectivement notés au cours des décennies 2000 et 2010 s'accompagnent des mêmes tendances dans les écoulements du printemps. A l'inverse, entre les décennies 1980–1990, il a été noté une hausse conjointe des pluies d'été et des écoulements d'automne. La flexion des pluies d'été notée depuis la décennie 2000 est également perceptible dans les écoulements d'automne. Ces résultats pourraient servir à renforcer les capacités de gestion des ressources en eau dans le bassin versant concerné et dans la région. Ils apportent également de nouveaux éléments pour étudier et comprendre la variation saisonnière et la disponibilité de l'eau douce en aval, dans les estuaires et les zones côtières des rivières régionales. The objective of this article is to assess recent trends of hydroclimatic quantities in Ogooue basin in the context of climate change. For this, the rainfall and discharges data of this basin were analyzed using the Pettitt test. The results of this study reveal a statistically significant decrease in runoff that the Pettitt test situates in 1972–1973, but nothing like that for rainfall at this same time scale. The decadal deviations from the interannual average, however show links between these variables essentially marked by a synchronous decrease in the 1970s and 1980s. This decrease is followed by a recovery in the two decades following (1990 and 2000), which stops again during the 2010s. The flow of the rainy seasons (Spring and Autumn) recorded the most important modifications, following variations in the rainfall regimes of the dry seasons (Winter and Summer) which precede them. The dry Winter season experienced a significant decrease in precipitation between the 1970s and 1990s, which caused a decrease in Spring flows. The increase and flexion noted respectively during the 2000 and 2010 decades are accompanied by the same trends in Spring flows. Conversely, between the 1980s and the 1990s, there was a joint increase in Summer rainfall and Autumn flows. The decrease of Summer rainfall noted since the 2000s is also noticeable in the Autumn flows. These results could be used to strengthen water resources management capacities in the watershed concerned and the region. They also provide new insights to study and understand seasonal variation and availability of freshwater downstream, in estuaries and coastal areas of regional rivers.",
