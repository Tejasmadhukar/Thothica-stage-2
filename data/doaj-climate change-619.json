    "abstract": "Trend detection based on hydroclimatological time series is crucial for understanding climate change. In this study, the innovative trend analysis (ITA) method was applied to investigate trends in air temperature and precipitation over the Jinsha River Basin (JRB), China, from 1961 to 2016 based on 40 meteorological stations. Climatic factors series were divided into three categories according to percentile, and the hidden trends were evaluated separately. The ITA results show that annual and seasonal temperatures have significantly increased whereas the variation range of annual temperature tended to narrow. Spatial pattern analysis of the temperature indicates that high elevation areas show more increasing trends than flat areas. Furthermore, according to ITA, significant increase trends are observed in annual precipitation and “high” category of spring precipitation. The sub-basins results show a significant decreasing trend in elevation zones of ≤ 2000 m and an increasing trend where elevation is > 2000 m. Moreover, linkage between temperature and precipitation was analyzed and the potential impact of the combined changes was demonstrated. The results of this study provide a reference for future water resources planning in the JRB and will help advance the understanding of climate change in similar areas.",

    "abstract": "As comunidades arbóreas de florestas tropicais localizadas em regiões com clima sazonal tendem a ajustar a fenologia da queda de folhas e da produção de flores e frutos à sazonalidade climática. Neste estudo monitoramos a comunidade arbórea de uma floresta semidecidual no período de quatro anos (2001 a 2004), a fim de analisar a relação entre o número de espécies perdendo folhas, florescendo e frutificando e a variação anual do comprimento do dia, precipitação e temperatura durante o período de observação. Além disso, avaliamos se essas três fenofases repetem os mesmos padrões em anos sucessivos. Regressões lineares simples indicaram que o número de espécies perdendo folhas foi negativamente relacionado com as três variáveis ambientais para os quatro anos de estudo, sendo o comprimento do dia e a temperatura os melhores preditores para esta fenofase. Houve também relação significativa do comprimento do dia com o número de espécies florescendo e frutificando nos quatro anos, porém, precipitação e temperatura não foram relacionadas com estas fenofases em todos os anos de estudo. Os testes de estatística circular indicaram forte sazonalidade para queda foliar, com data média durante o mês de julho independente do ano, ao passo que para floração e frutificação não foi detectada sazonalidade significativa. Como resultado, o número de espécies perdendo folhas foi correlacionado entre todos os anos sucessivos. Entretanto, não houve correlação do número de espécies florescendo e frutificando em 2003 e 2004, provavelmente devido às altas temperaturas ocorridas neste último ano. Os resultados deste estudo sugerem que a queda de folhas é uma fenofase altamente previsível temporalmente. Ao contrário, a floração e a frutificação podem variar ano a ano como conseqüência de anomalias climáticas. Essas variações podem ser relevantes para o entendimento dos efeitos em longo prazo de mudanças climáticas sobre as florestas sazonais.Tropical tree communities in regions with seasonal climate usually adjust leaf-fall, flowering and fruiting phenology to climate seasonality. Here we monitored a tree community over a 4-year period in order to assess the relationship between the number of species presenting leaf fall, flower and fruit and annual variation in day length, precipitation and temperature. Moreover, we asked whether the three phenological variables have the same patterns in successive years. Simple regression analyses showed that the number of species shedding leaves was negatively related to the three environmental variables during the four years, with day length and temperature as the best predictors. There was also a relationship between day length and the number of species flowering and fruiting, while rainfall and temperature were only related to these phenophases in some years. The circular statistics indicate highly significant seasonality only for leaf fall, whereas for flowering and fruiting significant seasonal patterns were not detected. The number of species in leaf fall was correlated between all successive years. However, the number of species in flower and fruit was not significantly correlated between 2003 and 2004. Overall, our results suggest that leaf fall is highly predictable over time. On the contrary, flowering and fruiting may present year-to-year variation as a result of climatic anomalies such as the high temperatures detected in 2004. These variations may be relevant to understand the effects of climate change on seasonal forests in long-term studies.",

    "abstract": "The topography and pedoclimatic conditions in Romania are diverse and in many places highly favourable for viticulture. In the past 21 years it was observed that the climate slowly changed, with a visible impact on grape quality. The influence of climate change on grape growing depends however on the vineyard location, relief and soil, multiple combination of varieties and rootstocks, water supply, as well as viticultural practices. The influence of the climate change was studied during a long period of time, between 1998 and 2018, in our experimental vineyard at UASVM Bucharest (N Lat.: 44∘47′07′′; E Long.: 26∘076′28′′; elevation 87 m), located in the Southern part of Romania. The observations made during last twenty one years on qualitative and quantitative parameters of the most widespread Romanian grape variety, Fetească regală grafted on the Kober 5 BB rootstock, along with the calculated values for the usual climatic indices describing viticultural climate, showed some significant climate changes in comparison with a reference period between 1961 and 1997 taken from the existent scientific literature. Our observations during past twenty years reveal a trend of increase in all studied temperature-dependent climatic indices during the grape growing season, with a large variation in the absolute minimum temperatures during winter, which suggests a shift towards an increased thermal amplitude between summer and winter temperatures in certain years. Compared with the reference period (1961–1997), an increase in the following temperature-dependent indices was observed: +0.75 ∘C for the average annual temperature; +0.78 ∘C for average temperature in the growing season; +2.37 ∘C for average maximum temperature in the warmest month; +2.11 ∘C for average maximum temperature in the summer; +234 units in Huglin index; + 173 units in Winkler index and +0.35 ∘C in Cool night index. These climate changes bring important variations of grape yield due to the minimum temperatures during winter and significant reduction of total acidity, along with a significant increase of sugar concentration. This study aids to understand and anticipate the rate of climate change in Southern Romania, the extent of the changes in grape quality and the interventions required to maintain constant grape and wine quality.",

    "abstract": "The overall goal of this study was to examine the effects of climate change on the yield of four distinct crops (Aus, Aman, Boro and Wheat) in Sylhet by using secondary climate data from 1970 to 2020. The study's other goal is to assess the impact of river water levels on crop productivity in Sylhet over time. Data on crop productivity, weather variability and river water levels were gathered from the various fields. Yield vs. climatic correlation was discovered in the study, and this correlation varied according to season. To estimate the impact of climate change on rice yield, a multiple regression model is used. Climate variables in the model were found to account for 11% of the overall variation in Aus rice yield. The relationship between relative humidity and maximum temperature is positive and statistically significant. Other variables had no effect on yield because they were not significant. Furthermore, Regression results indicated that climate variables account for 60.6 percent of the overall variation in Aman rice output. Relative humidity, on the other hand, can undermine the yield. Climate variables account for 53.5 percent of the overall variation in Boro rice output, according to the findings. As a result, an increase in rainfall may have a negative impact on Boro rice yield. Maximum and minimum temperatures might have a favorable impact on Boro rice yield. Increases in maximum temperature, on the other hand, can considerably boost Wheat yield while decreases in minimum temperature can diminish Wheat yield. On the other side, the results of the regression analysis suggest that river water level has a minor impact on Aus, Aman, and Boro yield. However, as the model demonstrates, the river water level can have an impact on wheat yield. The impact of temperature and rainfall on water level was also investigated in this study because the regression model failed to produce positive results. Surprisingly, the model performs well, despite the fact that maximum temperatures have a negative impact on water levels in the Aus and Aman seasons. This shows that if warmer temperatures aid raises Aus and Aman yields, then the water level cannot sabotage the yield rise. Rainfall has a favorable impact on the water levels in the Aus, Aman, and Boro seasons, but has a negative impact on the water levels in the Wheat season.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Long‐lived tree species are genetically differentiated and locally adapted with respect to fitness‐related traits, but the genetic basis of local adaptation remains largely unresolved. Recent advances in population genetics and landscape genomic analyses enable identification of putative adaptive loci and specific selective pressures acting on local adaptation. Here, we sampled 60 evergreen oak (Quercus aquifolioides) populations throughout the species' range and pool‐sequenced 587 individuals at drought‐stress candidate genes. We analyzed patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation for 381 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 65 candidate genes and eight microsatellites. Outlier loci were identified by genetic differentiation analysis and genome–environment associations. The response pattern of genetic variation to environmental gradient was assessed by linear isolation‐by‐distance/environment tests, redundancy analysis, and nonlinear methods. SNPs and microsatellites revealed two genetic lineages: Tibet and Hengduan Mountains–Western Sichuan Plateau (HDM‐WSP), with reduced genetic diversity in Tibet lineage. More outlier loci were detected in HDM‐WSP lineage than Tibet lineage. Among these, three SNPs in two genes responded to dry season precipitation in the HDM‐WSP lineage but not in Tibet. By contrast, genetic variation in the Tibet lineage was related to geographic distance instead of the environment. Furthermore, risk of nonadaptedness (RONA) analyses suggested HDM‐WSP lineage will have a better capacity to adapt in the predicted future climate compared with the Tibet lineage. We detected genetic imprints consistent with natural selection and molecular adaptation to drought on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) over a range of long‐lived and widely distributed oak species in a changing environment. Our results suggest that different within‐species adaptation processes occur in species occurring in heterogeneous environments.",

    "abstract": "Understanding vegetation C, N, and P stoichiometry helps us not only to evaluate biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions but also to predict the potential impact of environmental change on ecosystem processes. The foliar C, N, and P stoichiometry in Northern Tibetan grasslands, especially the controlling factors, has been highlighted in recent years. In this study, we have collected 340 plant samples and 162 soil samples from 54 plots in three grassland types, with the purpose of evaluating the foliar C, N, and P stoichiometry and underlying control factors in three grassland types along a 1,500-km east-to-west transect in the Northern Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicated that the averaged foliar C, N, and P concentrations were 425.9 ± 15.8, 403.4 ± 22.2, and 420.7 ± 30.7 g kg−1; 21.7 ± 2.9, 19.0 ± 2.3, and 21.7 ± 5.2 g kg−1; and 1.71 ± 0.29, 1.19 ± 0.16, and 1.59 ± 0.6 g kg−1 in the alpine meadow (AM), alpine steppe (AS), and desert steppe (DS) ecosystems, respectively. The foliar C and N ratios were comparable, with values of 19.8 ± 2.8, 20.6 ± 1.9, and 19.9 ± 5.8 in the AM, AS, and DS ecosystems, respectively. Both the C/P and N/P ratios are the lowest in the AM ecosystem, with values of 252.2 ± 32.6 and 12.8 ± 1.3, respectively, whereas the highest values of 347.3 ± 57.0 and 16.2 ± 3.2 were obtained in the AS ecosystem. In contrast, the soil C, N, C/P, and N/P values decreased from the AM to DS ecosystem. Across the whole transects, leaf C, N, and P stoichiometry showed no obvious trend, but soil C and N concentrations showed an increasing trend, and soil P concentrations showed a decreasing trend with the increasing longitude. Based on the general linear model analysis, the vegetation type was the dominant factor controlling the leaf C, N, and P stoichiometry, accounting for 42.8% for leaf C, 45.1% for leaf N, 35.2% for leaf P, 52.9% for leaf C/N, 39.6% for leaf C/P, and 48.0% for leaf N/P; the soil nutrients and climate have relatively low importance. In conclusion, our results supported that vegetation type, rather than climatic variation and soil nutrients, are the major determinants of north Tibet grassland leaf stoichiometry.",

    "abstract": "Lake Poopó is located in the Andean Mountain Range Plateau or Altiplano. A general decline in the lake water level has been observed in the last two decades, coinciding roughly with an intensification of agriculture exploitation, such as quinoa crops. Several factors have been linked with the shrinkage of the lake, including climate change, increased irrigation, mining extraction and population growth. Being an endorheic catchment, evapotranspiration (ET) losses are expected to be the main water output mechanism and previous studies demonstrated ET increases using Earth observation (EO) data. In this study, we seek to build upon these earlier findings by analyzing an ET time series dataset of higher spatial and temporal resolution, in conjunction with land cover and precipitation data. More specifically, we performed a spatio-temporal analysis, focusing on wet and dry periods, that showed that ET changes occur primarily in the wet period, while the dry period is approximately stationary. An analysis of vegetation trends performed using 500 MODIS vegetation index products (NDVI) also showed an overall increasing trend during the wet period. Analysis of NDVI and ET across land cover types showed that only croplands had experienced an increase in NDVI and ET losses, while natural covers showed either constant or decreasing NDVI trends together with increases in ET. The larger increase in vegetation and ET losses over agricultural regions, strongly suggests that cropping practices exacerbated water losses in these areas. This quantification provides essential information for the sustainable planning of water resources and land uses in the catchment. Finally, we examined the spatio-temporal trends of the precipitation using the newly available Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS-v2) product, which we validated with onsite rainfall measurements. When integrated over the entire catchment, precipitation and ET showed an average increasing trend of 5.2 mm yr−1 and 4.3 mm yr−1, respectively. This result suggests that, despite the increased ET losses, the catchment-wide water storage should have been offset by the higher precipitation. However, this result is only applicable to the catchment-wide water balance, and the location of water may have been altered (e.g., by river abstractions or by the creation of impoundments) to the detriment of the Lake Poopó downstream.",

Consequently, the availability of abundant glycerol, as a by-product in biodiesel production, is more obvious. Many institutions and companies have explored different routes to convert glycerol to highly-added chemical products and fuel additives. As the addition of the second reactant to glycerol may end up with worse exergy calculation, the conversion of glycerol over solid acid catalysts without the addition of the second reactant is preferred in this mini-review. Glycerol aromatization and glycerol dehydration over zeolite catalysts were focused with an emphasis on recent papers in the past 3 years. The role of acidity, hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity, zeolite frameworks are highlighted. The presence of water in the glycerol feed affected the stability of the catalysts. Low cost and naturally abundant zeolite and minerals are proposed. Numerous low-cost catalysts such as natural zeolites and natural clays are potentially used for this purpose.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is occurring in the central US and is interacting with agroecological factors to increase biotic stress in sunflower. Certain species of Diaporthe cause Phomopsis stem canker in sunflower and other dicotyledonous weeds and crops. The increase in precipitation already observed in the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota have increased the chances of outbreaks of necrotrophic pathogens, like Diaporthe. We discuss how climate trends, combined with technological, management, and economic interactions, are correlated with increasing incidence of Phomopsis stem canker in these and adjacent areas in North America. Further, we discuss management options and the role of improved sunflower genetics in reducing Phomopsis stem canker outbreak risk.",
