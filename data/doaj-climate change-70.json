    "abstract": "This study utilized hot and cold indices to evaluate the changes in extreme temperature events that occurred in subtropical highland climates from 1991 to 2020. The modified Mann–Kendall (MMK) test and the Theil–Sen (TS) slope estimator were used to analyze the linear trends in the time series of the extreme temperature indices. The northern highlands of Pakistan (NHP) were considered as a case study region. The results showed that the annual maximum temperature had a slightly increasing tendency (at the rate of 0.14 °C/decade), while the annual minimum temperature had a slightly decreasing tendency (at the rate of −0.02 °C/decade). However, these trends were not significant at the 5% significance level. The decadal averages of the hot indices were the highest in the second decade (2000s), while they were the lowest in the subsequent decade (2010s). In comparison, all the cold indices except the annual minimum value of the maximum temperature (TXn) showed a persistent decline in their decadal averages throughout the 2000s and 2010s. Overall, the frequency of hot days significantly increased in the NHP during the study period. This study found that the hot days and coldest days increased over the past three decades in the NHP. However, there was a decreasing trend in the cold spell duration, cold nights, and the coldest nights over the past three decades, as demonstrated by the trends of the cold spell duration index (CSDI), the temperature of cold nights (TN10p), and the annual minimum value of the minimum temperature (TNn) indices. These changes may impact the environment, human health, and agricultural operations. The findings provide useful insights into the shifting patterns of extreme temperature events in northern Pakistan and have crucial implications for the climate-change-adaptation and resilience-building initiatives being undertaken in the region. It is suggested that the continuous monitoring of extreme temperature events is necessary to comprehend their effects on the region and devise strategies for sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "Bathymetry data offer interesting opportunities for the analysis of contaminant distribution patterns. This research utilized lead surficial sediment sample data from Lake Ontario that were collected by the Canada Centre for Inland Waters in 1968 and 1998. Traditionally, two-dimensional analyses such as dot maps or proportional circle representation have been utilized to examine pollutant levels. Generating area estimates allows for expanded spatial analysis of contaminant distribution patterns. Lake-wide surfaces were derived using the ordinary kriging technique. These were then layered on bathymetry data to examine three-dimensional relationships between observed pollution patterns and lake-bottom features. Spatial variability was observed in both the 1968 and 1998 datasets. Contamination levels in 1998 dropped substantially, especially in areas that were previously the most heavily polluted and above the Probable Effect Level (4660.23 km2 or 26.72% of the common analysis area lake-bottom in 1998 versus 6189.07 km2 or 62.00% in 1968). Conversely, areas below the Threshold Effect Level increased from 922.09 km2 (5.29%) in 1968 to 3484.22 km2 (19.98%) in 1998. In both years, shallow and sill/ridge areas tended to have lower levels of contamination than deeper lake basins or contaminant inflow areas. The 1968 dataset likely provides a more detailed estimation surface as there were more points available for interpolation procedures. The kriging surfaces when combined with bathymetry, sedimentology information, and knowledge of physical processes provide a comprehensive illustration of the contaminant distributions whether they are high (1968) or when loadings are significantly reduced (1998). The results have implications for future sediment assessment programs and survey design on a lake-wide basis. The bathymetry data allowed for enhanced interpretation and an improved understanding of observed lead pollution patterns.",

    "abstract": "In the Netherlands, the administrative law system is traditionally seen as best suited for dealing with public interest-related lawsuits. Especially in the field of environmental law, NGOs seeking to promote broader environmental interests regularly initiate judicial procedures before administrative courts in order to challenge land-use plans, environmental permits and other types of public orders that may have adverse impacts on local natural habitats and/or the environment more generally. However, over the past five years a number of developments have resulted in a more restricted access to administrative courts for environmental NGOs. It has been suggested that these developments may result in an increased reliance on public interest-related procedures before civil courts. This raises the question of what position public interest-related claims, like those against Shell for oil pollution in the Niger Delta and those against the Dutch government for its alleged failure to implement adequate climate change policies, currently have within the Dutch system of civil procedure. It also raises the question whether environmental NGOs in practice do have the broad access to Dutch courts that is required by international obligations, and whether room for improvement should perhaps be sought in the civil law domain.",

    "abstract": "Earth observation can provide managers with valuable information on ongoing coastal processes and major trends in coastline evolution, especially in data-poor regions. This paper examines the use of optical satellite images in the mapping of the changes in shoreline position before, during, and after the implementation of a protection scheme. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) to demonstrate the potential of satellite imagery as an effective, robust, and low-cost tool to remotely monitor the effectiveness of protective structures based on a large-scale case study in West Africa; and (ii) to compile lessons learned from this case study that can be used in the design of future interventions. The analysis shows that before the implementation of the protection scheme, the coastal sector was retreating at a rate of −1.6 m/year, which is in line with the average retreat rates reported in other studies for the region. After project implementation, this trend reversed into shoreline accretion at a rate of +1.0 m/year, locally experiencing positive and negative oscillations in the short term. Furthermore, the shoreline-extracted positions proved useful in assessing the impact of differences in the groynes’ permeability with respect to temporary leeside erosion. Finally, it is recommended to continue this monitoring to assess long-term trends.",

The compilation come from diverse historical and documentary sources and span the time interval from 1525 to 1936 covering a period of 412 years. There is a total of 3074 datum, which reach up to 67.83% of the total implying a 32.17% of missing data. However, we have only reconstructed the captures for the time interval 1700–1936 and we provide these reconstructions only for this time interval and for 9 out of 11 series due to the scarcity and inhomogeneity of the two oldest capture time series. This reconstructed database provides an invaluable opportunity for fisheries and marine research as well as for multidisciplinary research in climate change.

    "abstract": "One of the key issues in climate risk management is to develop climate resilient infrastructure so as to ensure safety and sustainability of urban functioning systems as well as mitigate the adverse impacts associated with increasing climate hazards. However, conventional methods of assessing risks do not fully address the interaction of various subsystems within the city system and are unable to consolidate diverse opinions of various stakeholders on their assessments of sector-specific risks posed by climate change. To address this gap, this study advances an integrated-systems-analysis tool - Climate Risk Assessment of Infrastructure Tool (CRAIT), and applies it to analyze and compare the extent of risk factor exposure and vulnerability over time across five critical urban infrastructure sectors in Shanghai and Shenzhen, two cities that have distinctive geo-climate profiles and histories of infrastructure development. The results show significantly higher level of variation between the two cities in terms of vulnerability levels than that of exposure. More specifically, the sectors of critical buildings, water, energy, and information & communication in Shenzhen have significantly higher vulnerability levels than Shanghai in both the 2000s and the 2050s. We further discussed the vulnerability levels of subsystems in each sector and proposed twelve potential adaptation options for the roads system based on four sets of criteria: technical feasibility, flexibility, co-benefits, and policy compatibility. The application of CRAIT is bound to be a knowledge co-production process with the local experts and stakeholders. This knowledge co-production process highlights the importance of management advancements and nature-based green solutions in managing climate change risk in the future though differences are observed across the efficacy categories due to the geographical and meteorological conditions in the two cities. This study demonstrates that this knowledge co-creation process is valuable in facilitating policymakers' decision-making and their feedback to scientific understanding in climate risk assessment, and that this approach has general applicability for cities in other regions and countries.",

Climate change leads to increased shipping, tourism, and oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, creating new risks that need to be mitigated. The three major challenges to Arctic SAR are: (i) limited SAR capabilities, (ii) a multi-jurisdictional context with multiple Danish/Greenlandic and civilian/military authorities involved, and (iii) the need for coordination of a diverse set of organizational units operating both onshore and offshore. We use the case of a large-scale SAR exercise, LIVEX 2016, held off the west coast of Greenland, to explore these challenges from a three-tier analytical approach: 'Scalability', which investigates surge capacity in crisis management, 'Synchronization', which focuses on challenges related to the creation and maintenance of a situational picture during a SAR operation, and 'Speed of decision', which looks at how complex matters are managed in a multi-jurisdictional context under time pressure. Our findings show: (i) that surge capacity requires more focus on integration than activation, (ii), that actors must question information and challenge their own interpretations to maintain a synchronized situational awareness, and (iii) that urgency may result in a decrease of speed in decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Submersible pumps, widely used in deep wells drilled to meet the water needs of users in urban areas, add an additional load to the conventional electricity grid infrastructure and are responsible for increasing the concentration of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. The main objective of this study is to investigate the technical and economic feasibility of using solar photovoltaic (PV) energy to reduce the net power drawn from the grid by submersible pumps in urban water supply systems. The Germiraltı catchment area (Kayseri, Turkey), which provides all of its energy needs from the city electricity grid, was chosen as the research area. Two different scenarios, ‘hybrid-powered water pumping system’ and ‘grid-connected PV system’, were analyzed and evaluated. A 1,620 kWp grid-connected PV system can inject 2,787.8 MWh/year of energy into the grid, which is more than the total annual energy need of the submersible pumps. The system operates with 85.7% performance ratio (PR), 19.6% capacity factor (CF) and 4.71 (h/d) final yield. The payback period of the system is calculated as 4.1 years. The results show that it is economically competitive to meet the energy needs of submersible pumps in urban water supply systems with solar PV energy. HIGHLIGHTS Submersible pumps, which have been widely used in urban water supply systems, consume a considerable amount of energy.; Feasibility of using solar PV energy in urban water supply systems is investigated.; Two scenarios, ‘hybrid-powered water pumping system’ and ‘grid-connected PV system’, are analyzed and evaluated.; The grid-connected PV system is found to be a more feasible and viable alternative for Germiraltı catchment area.;",

With the intensification of cocoa production, there has been a shift in traditional cocoa farming over the years leading to the removal of shade trees, hence, removal of carbon sinks. This study was carried out to compare the amount of carbon stored in cocoa ecosystems to that of a 20 years teak plantation and to calculate the trade-off of carbon between the two systems. Cocoa farms of similar ages (20 years) were selected in which three-subplots were demarcated on each farm at Piase in the Bosomtwe District. Tree Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) was measured and soils samples were collected and analyzed for organic carbon percentage and bulk density. One-way Analysis of Variance was used to analyze above and belowground tree carbon and two-way analysis of variance was used to analyze soil organic carbon stored. Teak plantation recorded higher carbon stock (739.33±2.24 Mg C.ha-1) compared to full sun cocoa (9.36±2.24 Mg C.ha-1). Soil organic carbon across the three farms showed significant (p = 0.0010) variations with depths. The 0-20 cm soil depth stored significantly more (p = 0.0000) organic carbon compared to 20-40 cm soil depth. Total soil carbon stored revealed significant differences amongst the various farms with the full sun (40.857±0.52 Mg C.ha-1) being the least whilst the teak plantation stored the highest (72.42±0.52 Mg C.ha-1). Total carbon (above-ground tree carbon + below-ground tree carbon + soil organic carbon) showed significant difference (p= 0.0000) between land use types with shaded cocoa farm (74.3±0.89 Mg C.ha-1), full sun cocoa farm (32.02±0.89Mg C.ha-1) and that of the teak plantation (950.91±0.89 Mg C.ha-1) respectively. Traditional cocoa ecosystem (shaded cocoa farms) has the potential to store carbon significantly higher than that of the full sun systems.",
