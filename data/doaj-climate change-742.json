    "abstract": "While few have contemplated the potential impacts of climate change on small-scale fisheries and fishermen in the Colombian Pacific, understanding these effects is crucial for devising effective adaptation strategies. This study presents the outcomes of a vulnerability assessment related to climate change for fishermen in the Colombian South Pacific. The assessment employed a multivariable model that considered the sensitivity of marine and coastal ecosystems that support fishing resources alongside fishermen’s adaptability to changes in the biophysical environment. Socioeconomic factors were also scrutinized. The study revealed that 80% of the surveyed fishermen are at a medium to high level of vulnerability due to changes in the distribution of key commercial species, which influences the productivity of their traditional fishing sites. Their vulnerability is primarily attributed to low usage of fishing technologies, the boat engine’s limited propulsion capacity, and a lack of diversity and sustainability in fishing gear. These elements increase their reliance on fishing sites close to the coast (approximately 3 km to 5 km from the shoreline), resulting in a low adaptive capacity for the fishermen. The dominant factor driving the sensitivity component was the economic significance of the fishing gear and the fact that the gear could be more diverse and durable. These findings provide a critical scientific basis for assessing the fishing sector’s vulnerability to climate change and informing future collaborative decision-making in managing small-scale fisheries in the Colombian South Pacific Ocean.",

    "abstract": "The distribution dynamics of invasive alien plants is the fundamental information for early detection and rapid response (EDRR) to these species in a new habitat. Based on the field survey data and online databases, the present research work utilized Maximum Entropy model (Maxent) to simulate the distribution dynamics of four invasive plants Ageratina adenophora (Spreng.) R. M. King et H. Rob., Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb., Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. and Mikania micrantha Kunth in China, under current and future climate (2041–2060, 2061–2080, 2081–2100) in two shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs: SSP 245 and 585) of the newly released coupled model intercomparison project phase6 (CMIP6). All the suitable habitat areas of these plants will significantly expand in the future, but at different expansion levels. M. micrantha will have the largest distribution area (increase by 61–120%), while A. adenophora will expand by 7–33%, A. philoxeroides by 12–74%, and A. artemisiifolia by 8–27%, respectively. Additionally, the habitat centers of the four species will shift to north, i.e., A. philoxeroides, A. artemisiifolia and M. micrantha to northwest, and A. adenophora to northeast, except that the core distributions of A. adenophora and A. artemisiifolia will move to southwest under one certain environment scenario (SSP 245 in the period of 2061–2080). Compared to aspect index and slope topographical variables, the population density, temperature, and precipitation are found to be more important variables in describing the distribution of these plants. The dynamics of habitats of these four species and the correlating driver factors proposed in this work provide essential insights into future spatial management of invasive plants and biodiversity conservation in China, which is, not only human activities should be regulated and the migration of invasive species be reduced, but also the monitoring of high-risk areas should be strengthened in order to ensure effective EDRR.",

Breakthroughs regarding ozone observation methods and the formation principles of ozone holes have occurred. This study compared the slant column ozone obtained from SCanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) Level 1 optical spectroscopy data processed by QDOAS software with that reconstructed from SCIAMACHY Level 2 ozone data using geographic information to obtain the optical depth coefficients. The global distribution of optical depth coefficients reveals latitudinal homogeneity, whereas the distribution of coefficients in the polar regions reveals heterogeneity. This heterogeneity has an annual variation pattern, alternating between strong and weak distributions in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It is most evident in the Palmer Peninsula of Antarctica, where the optical depth coefficients were significantly higher than those of the surrounding regions at the same latitude. This analysis excluded the atmospheric pressure influence and suggested the influence of the continental shelf depth. The protrusion of the continental shelf depth changes the optical depth coefficients owing to the geographical proximity of the Antarctic Palmer Peninsula to South America, which separates the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in an east–west direction.",

    "abstract": "This research describes the change in temperatures across approximately 270 tropical cities from 1960 to 2020 with a focus on urban warming. It associates urban growth indicators with temperature variations in tropical climate zones (tropical rainforest, tropical monsoon, and tropical wet-dry savanna). Our findings demonstrate that over time while temperatures have increased across the tropics, urban residents have experienced higher temperatures (minimum and maximum) than those living outside of cities. Moreover, in certain tropical zones, over the study period, temperatures have risen faster in urban areas than the background (non-urban) temperatures. The results also suggest that with continuing climate change and urban growth, temperatures will continue to rise at higher than background levels in tropical cities unless mitigation measures are implemented. Several fundamental characteristics of urban growth including population size, population density, infrastructure and urban land use patterns are factors associated with variations in temperatures. We find evidence that dense urban forms (compact residential and industrial developments) are associated with higher temperatures and population density is a better predictor of variation in temperatures than either urban population size or infrastructure in most tropic climate zones. Infrastructure, however, is a better predictor of temperature increases in wet-dry savanna tropical climates than population density. There are a number of potential mitigation measures available to urban managers to address heat. We focus on ecological services, but whether these services can address the projected increasing heat levels is unclear. More local research is necessary to untangle the various contributions to increasing heat in cities and evaluate whether these applications can be effective to cool tropical cities as temperature continue to rise. Our methods include combining several different datasets to identify differences in daily, seasonal, and annual maximum and minimum temperatures.",

    "abstract": "The Taiwan coastal areas are facing predicted sea-level rise effects in the global climate change context. Better understanding of the mechanisms and forcing factors driving the geomorphological evolution of Taiwan’s coastline is essential. We highlight the potential of small river estuaries as archives of coastal evolution and provide a paleo-environmental reconstruction of the Gangkou River estuary based on results from a combined methodological approach using geomorphological, sedimentological, and geochronological analyses. A consistent chronology was established by combining Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating, as well as radiocarbon dating techniques. A distinct beach-rock layer allowed firm correlation of six investigated coastal profiles. Eustatic sea level change was identified as the primary coastal and estuarine landscape development forcing factor in the study area. Tectonic forcing could also be detected from the investigated sites, but has to be regarded as a subordinate secondary forcing factor. The Gangkou River estuary developed in the early Holocene at about 8 ka and was fully developed by the time the Holocene sea-level maximum was reached. With the sea-level dropping until modern times, estuarine zone relocation and a transition to terrestrial processes was initiated, leading to development of the current coastal dune system since about 2.5 ka. Major dune building phases correlate with the climate change associated with the Little Ice Age (LIA) event and stabilised towards recent times, which is in accordance with regional and over-regional coastal Aeolian records in Taiwan.",

The objective of this study is to identify technological and socio-cultural factors that can threatening the sustainability of food self-sufficiency in West Java Province. This study uses multidimensional scaling analysis to assess the sustainability index and status and supported by a descriptive analysis of key factors that can provide inhibiting factors for the sustainability of food self-sufficiency. The results of the analysis describe that the ecological, economic and institutional aspects have sufficient influence on sustainability in food self-sufficiency, while the socio-cultural aspects and aspects of technology provide less sustainable effects in supporting the sustainability of food self-sufficiency. Factors in the use of certified seeds, area of paddy fields and irrigated rice fields, use of tools and machines for rice production and rice cropping indexes are key factors in technological aspects that can be a threat to the sustainability of food self-sufficiency. While the threat to the sustainability of food self-sufficiency in the socio-cultural aspects come from the factor of the number of workers in the food crops sub-sector, the pattern of consumption of carbohydrate food in the community and the distribution of rice. Governance of these key factors is key in developing sustainability of food self-sufficiency in West Java Province.",

These conditions are extremely relevant in developing countries already burdened with population growth and unchecked urban expansion, especially in the tropical global southern hemisphere. Engineering new crops thus has potential to enhance food security, prevent hunger, and spur sustainable agricultural growth. A major tool for the improvement of plant varieties in this context could be the manipulation of homologous recombination and genome haploidization during meiosis. The isolation or the design of mutations in key meiotic genes may facilitate DNA recombination and transmission of important genes quickly and efficiently. Genome haploidization through centromeric histone mutants could be an option to create new crosses rapidly. This review covers technical approaches to engineer key meiotic genes in tropical crops as a blueprint for future work and examples of tropical crops in which such strategies could be applied are given.",

Various prototype models have been proposed to explain these rapid climate fluctuations, and no agreement has emerged on which may be the more correct for describing the palaeoclimatic signal. In this work, we assess the bimodality of the system, reconstructing the topology of the multi-dimensional attractor over which the climate system evolves. We use high-resolution ice core isotope data to investigate the statistical properties of the climate fluctuations in the period before the onset of the abrupt change. We show that Dansgaard–Oeschger events have weak early warning signals if the ensemble of events is considered. We find that the statistics are consistent with the switches between two different climate equilibrium states in response to a changing external forcing (e.g. solar, ice sheets), either forcing directly the transition or pacing it through stochastic resonance. These findings are most consistent with a model that associates Dansgaard–Oeschger with changing boundary conditions, and with the presence of a bifurcation point.",

    "abstract": "The National Park Service (NPS) manages hundreds of parks in the United States, and many contain important aquatic ecosystems and/or threatened and endangered aquatic species vulnerable to hydro-climatic change. More effective management of park resources under future hydro-climatic uncertainty requires information on both baseline conditions and the range of projected future conditions. A monthly water balance model was used to assess baseline (1981–1999) conditions and a range of projected future hydro-climatic conditions in 374 NPS parks. General circulation model outputs representing 214 future climate simulations were used to drive the model. Projected future changes in air temperature (T), precipitation (p), and runoff (R) are expressed as departures from historical baselines. Climate simulations indicate increasing T by 2030 for all parks with 50th percentile simulations projecting increases of 1.67 °C or more in 50% of parks. Departures in 2030 p indicate a mix of mostly increases and some decreases, with 50th percentile simulations projecting increases in p in more than 70% of parks. Departures in R for 2030 are mostly decreases, with the 50th percentile simulations projecting decreases in R in more than 50% of parks in all seasons except winter. Hence, in many NPS parks, R is projected to decrease even when p is projected to increase because of increasing T in all parks. Projected changes in future hydro-climatic conditions can also be assessed for individual parks, and Rocky Mountain National Park and Congaree National Park are used as examples.",
