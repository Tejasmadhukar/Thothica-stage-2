    "abstract": "Human disturbance and climate change can easily lead to the shift of dryland ecological quality. However, how to comprehensively assess the shift of dryland ecological quality remains challenging. The ecological quality of specific dryland ecosystem in Northern China is less investigated following the launch of long-term large-scale national ecological restoration projects. This study established a dryland ecological quality assessment framework by the “One-out, all-out (1OAO)” principle. The ecological quality dynamics of Otindag sandy land in Northern China was evaluated by choosing 16 years (2000–2015) ecological quality as a baseline and comparing it to the report period (2005–2020). Three indicators, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil organic carbon (SOC) and dust sandstorm (DSS) was used to represent vegetation, soil and atmosphere quality, respectively. Our results showed that the vegetation quality kept stable in most areas, improved area of vegetation quality accounted for 30% of Otindag sandy land. The soil quality improved and degraded area accounted for 10% and 83%, respectively. The atmosphere quality increased in 98% area of Otindag sandy land. Overall, the ecological quality of Otindag sandy land improved in one fifth but degraded in four fifth following the launch of the national ecology restoration projects. Both degradation area is persistent since 2000 and no recent degradation found compared baseline to report period. The improvement was mainly in the southeastern part and the degradation was in western part of Otindag sandy land. This study provides practical basis for the scientific evaluation of dryland ecological quality dynamics and will facilitate the regional ecosystem management.",

Effective management of such incidents is crucial to ensure that members of the public are able and willing to take appropriate protective actions. The workshop described in this paper brought together researchers, practitioners and policy makers with expertise in emergency planning, preparedness and response to generate recommendations for major incident management. Workshop participants agreed that understanding the psychosocial aspects of major incidents is crucial to effective incident response, and a number of key themes were raised during workshop discussions. Based on these themes, four key recommendations can be made for informing planning and preparedness for major incidents.",

The out-of-phase relationship between the AO and ozone in the lower stratosphere is significant in January during P1 and February during P2, but it is insignificant in January during P2 and February during P1. The variable links between the AO and ozone in the lower stratosphere over the Arctic in January and February are not caused by changes in the spatial pattern of AO but are related to the anomalies in the planetary wave propagation between the troposphere and stratosphere. The upward propagation of the planetary wave in the stratosphere related to the positive phase of AO significantly weakens in January during P1 and in February during P2, which may be related to negative buoyancy frequency anomalies over the Arctic. When the AO is in the positive phase, the anomalies of planetary wave further contribute to the negative ozone anomalies via weakening the Brewer–Dobson circulation and decreasing the temperature in the lower stratosphere over the Arctic in January during P1 and in February during P2.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of individual strategies to fight against climate change is a major issue both scientifically and environmentally as well as socially. This paper examines how people’s perceptions and territories characteristics could become barriers or drivers of action on climate change. The approach is based on a comparative study between Lille and Chauny, two towns climatically comparable, but differing from geographic and socio-economic factors. The findings show a diversity of perceptions and strategies to fight depending on two key determinants : geographic context and socio-economic variables. We demonstrate a diversity in climate change perceptions both related to people individual’s feeling, their educational level, and their main source of information. In terms of strategies to fight against climate change, our results reveal significant correlations between the measures adopted by people surveyed and their living standards. In our two study sites, most of the measures implemented are focused on climate change mitigation. Furthermore, people residing in Lille are more inclined to take mitigation actions than Chauny’s residents. One reason that could explain this difference between Lille and Chauny is the territorial and economic context.",

    "abstract": "Climate variables play an important role in the increase of tree ring width (TRW), which is one of the primary paleoclimate signals. In this study, we apply new methods for understanding tree growth responses to climate variables under anthropogenic climate change. This study uses regression and artificial intelligence (AI) modelling techniques to develop a model describing the relationships between climate variables and the tree ring standardised growth index (TRSGI) in northeast South Korea. We examined data from 1901 to 1998, and then used data from 1999 to 2019 to reconstruct the TRSGI. This study comprised four major steps. In the first step, we evaluated the performance of the Climate Reach Unit (CRU) TS4.03 in comparison to synoptic station in situ data by using three well-known bias correction methods, namely delta, quantile mapping, and empirical quantile mapping. CRU TS4.03 obtained the highest cross-correlation coefficients (r2 > 0.90) within the synoptic station data. In the second step, different temperatures, precipitation, vapour pressure, and two drought indices were analysed using TRSGI. In the third step, the Mann-Kendall test was run to detect climate and TRSGI data trends, and it showed that all variables had increasing trends at a significance level of 0.05 during 1901–1998. Finally, in the fourth and final step, by selecting the most significant factors from the statistical tests, four models were developed: multiple linear regression (MLR), stepwise regression (SR), nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX), and NARX de-noised wavelet, the last of which was a model we developed by combining NARX and de-noised wavelet models. The results indicated that MLR with r = 0.44 (p < 0.003) and SR with r = 0.27 (p < 0.001) were not strong enough to reconstruct TRSGI. In contrast, the NARX de-noised model (r = 0.80) performed better than the NARX model (r = 0.78), showing highly similar trends to the observed TRSGI in the case study area. This research highlights the high performance of AI approaches for modelling TRW data in comparison to regression models. AI techniques may improve the accuracy of climate variable estimations and reconstructions that use TRW data. The presented artificial neural network method has the potential to be a highly effective method for TRW studies.",

    "abstract": "The increasing frequency of spillover of zoonotic pathogens from animals to humans in recent years highlights a need to develop a more comprehensive framework to investigate and prevent pathogens of animal origin, including rodents. Despite the presence of several species of rodents, there is a certain knowledge gap regarding rodent-borne zoonoses in Qatar. The current review provides an update on rodent-borne zoonoses in Qatar, its possible drivers and transmission dynamics, and proposed a One Health framework for intervention. Following an extensive literature review, we conducted a field investigation. Then the qualitative information and knowledge gaps were addressed with a virtual discussion with national, regional, and international experts in the relevant field. Overall, Rattus norvegicus population was found to be more prevalent, followed by Rattus rattus, and M. musculus, which are mainly found in animal farms, followed by agricultural farms, residential areas, and other facilities. Over 50% of rodents carry at least one pathogen of public health importance. Several pathogens were identified at the human, animal, and ecosystem interface, which can be mediated in transmission by rodents. E. coli, Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter spp. are the frequently reported bacteria. Hymenolepis spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Entamoeba spp., and Toxoplasma spp. are the major parasites. In addition, many vectors, including Ornithonyssus bacoti and Xenopsylla astia were reported in this country. Based on the changes over the past 70 years in Qatar, seven drivers have been identified, which could be important in rodent-borne disease emergences, such as the Oil and gas revolution, fast population growth, rapid urbanization, importation of food and agricultural products, agricultural and livestock development, farm biosecurity, and stray animals. The experts emphasized that mixed-species animal farming with poor biosecurity and management can be associated to increase the risk of zoonoses. Moreover, rapid urbanization and global climate change together can alter the ecosystem of the country and impact on vectors and vector-borne diseases. Finally, the One Health framework has been proposed for the surveillance, and mitigation of any future spillover or epidemic of rodent-borne zoonoses.",

    "abstract": "The Valparaiso region in Chile was decreed a zone affected by catastrophe in 2019 as a consequence of one of the driest seasons of the last 50 years. In this study, three varieties (‘Alfa-INIA’, ‘California-INIA’, and one landrace, ‘Local Navidad’) of kabuli-type chickpea seeds produced in 2018 (control) and 2019 (climate-related catastrophe, hereafter named water stress) were evaluated for their grain yield. Furthermore, the flavonoid profile of both free and esterified phenolic extracts was determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the concentration of the main flavonoid, biochanin A, was determined using liquid chromatography with diode array detection. The grain yield was decreased by up to 25 times in 2019. The concentration of biochanin A was up to 3.2 times higher in samples from the second season (water stress). This study demonstrates that water stress induces biosynthesis of biochanin A. However, positive changes in the biochanin A concentration are overshadowed by negative changes in the grain yield. Therefore, water stress, which may be worsened by climate change in the upcoming years, may jeopardize both the production of chickpeas and the supply of biochanin A, a bioactive compound that can be used to produce dietary supplements and/or nutraceuticals.",

    "abstract": "Increasing precipitation by climate change and the growing number of impervious areas present greater risk of disaster damage in urban areas. Urban green infrastructure can be an effective mitigation alternative in highly developed and concentrated area. This study investigates the effect of various types of urban green infrastructure on mitigating disaster damage in Korea. Tobit model is used to analyze the factors that determine disaster damage. Damage variation is predicted with scenarios of RCP 8.5 and urban green spaces. Seventy-four districts and counties in seven metropolitan areas are defined as the unit and the period from 2005 to 2013 is considered in the analysis. The results indicate that higher urban green ratio, sewer length, financial independence rate, and local government’s budget are relating to lower disaster damage. Based on a precipitation level of RCP 8.5 scenario in 2050, an increase in economic damage is expected to range from 262 to 1086%. However, with an increase in urban green ratio by 10%, increased economic damage is only expected to range from 217 to 1013%. The results suggest that green spaces play important role to mitigate precipitation related disasters. Highly concentrated urban areas need to consider various types of urban green infrastructure to prepare for an increase in precipitation due to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Green energy is a crucial component in addressing expanding energy demands and combating climate change, but the possible negative repercussions of these technologies are frequently disregarded. Green energy’s deployment is tied to environmentally sustainable development goals (SDGs). It can only be achieved by scaling up the finance of investment that provides environmental benefits through new financial instruments and new policies, such as green banks, green bonds, community-based green funds, green central banking, etc. In an effort to address the issues with IPAT and ImPACT, this study employed the STIRPAT model approach, which is a proven framework for energy economics analysis. The author gathers yearly data spanning 2002–2018 for six ASEAN member countries with the aim of investigating the relationship between CO2 emissions, green finance, energy efficiency, and the green energy index (GEX). After preliminary tests, the study employed the Westerlund test and Johansen Fisher test for long-term equilibrium and estimated the Granger causal links between variables using the generalized method of moments (GMM). The results indicate that green bonds are an effective technique for promoting green energy projects and considerably reducing CO2 emissions. Therefore, governments should establish supporting policies with a long-term perspective to increase the investment of green energy projects related investment from private participants to ensure sustainable growth and address environmental challenges. This strategy may be appropriate during and after the COVID-19 period.",
