    "abstract": "Abstract Background The medical field causes significant environmental impact. Reduction of the primary care practice carbon footprint could contribute to decreasing global carbon emissions. This study aims to quantify the average carbon footprint of a primary care consultation, describe differences between primary care practices (best, worst and average performing) in western Switzerland and identify opportunities for mitigation. Methods We conducted a retrospective carbon footprint analysis of ten private practices over the year 2018. We used life-cycle analysis to estimate carbon emissions of each sector, from manufacture to disposal, expressing results as CO2 equivalents per average consultation and practice. We then modelled an average and theoretical best- case and worst-case practices. Collected data included invoices, medical and furniture inventories, heating and power supply, staff and patient transport, laboratory analyses (in/out-house) waste quantities and management costs. Results An average medical consultation generated 4.8 kg of CO2eq and overall, an average practice produced 30 tons of CO2eq per year, with 45.7% for staff and patient transport and 29.8% for heating. Medical consumables produced 5.5% of CO2eq emissions, while in-house laboratory and X-rays contributed less than 1% each. Emergency analyses requiring courier transport caused 5.8% of all emissions. Support activities generated 82.6% of the total CO2eq. Simulation of best- and worst-case scenarios resulted in a ten-fold variation in CO2eq emissions. Conclusion Optimizing structural and organisational aspects of practice work could have a major impact on the carbon footprint of primary care practices without large-scale changes in medical activities.",

    "abstract": "The European Union PESETA IV project has produced a comprehensive dataset that quantifies the impact of climate change on river flooding and damage in Europe. This data potentially has significant application in the insurance industry, but requires some steps of post-processing, and appropriate delivery mechanisms, before it can be used in practice. The post-processing approach we apply involves statistical modelling of the simulated changes in damage to estimate rates of change of log damage versus global mean surface temperature (GMST). Under linear assumptions, these rates of change can be used to calculate the change in damage between any two time-periods for any GMST scenario. Under further assumptions, these changes can be used to adjust many of the metrics of flood risk used in the insurance industry, such as average annual losses, exceedance probabilities and year loss tables. We deliver these results in two ways to suit different users in the insurance industry. First, the rates of change, and related correlations, are provided as freely available datasets for insurers who prefer to process and apply the data themselves. Second, commercial online software is provided that performs some steps of the processing and application. Many sources of uncertainty affect our results. The results must not therefore be interpreted too literally, but hopefully give a good indication of the sign and rough magnitude of the likely changes in river flood damage due to climate change. Future studies will hopefully reduce the uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Herbicide-resistant weeds currently challenge sustainable food production in almost all cropping systems in Europe. Herbicide resistance is increasing, and some European countries are among the most affected globally, such as Spain and France. This situation is worsening not only due to herbicide use restrictions but also due to climate change, rendering Mediterranean countries such as Spain particularly susceptible. Therefore, focus should be aimed at preventive measures, which include those not only based on integrated weed management strategies but also based on a very good knowledge of the biology and ecology of each weed species. The main objective of this review is to provide an overview of potential future herbicide-resistant cases that can evolve in the near future in Europe. We use Spain as the case study, as it is the most affected country in Europe and because it is at risk due to global warming. For different resistant cases detailed on a crop basis, adequate prevention and management measures will be provided in order to avoid resistance evolution relative to the sites of action that are most likely to generate resistant biotypes due to expected high selection pressures.",

    "abstract": "Land use and land cover in the Dano catchment is characterized by a rapid conversion from seminatural vegetation (fallow) to agriculture (cropland). The study compares both the saturated (Ks) and the unsaturated (Kh) hydraulic conductivities under cropland and fallow in the catchment to gain insights into the effect of the current land use on soil water dynamics. Hydraulic conductivity was measured under forty-two (42) pairs of adjacent cropland-fallow plots using a Hood infiltrometer. Ks, Kh, bulk density, and soil texture were further compared using a paired two-tailed Student’s t-test (p=0.05). The results showed that both Ks and Kh are highly variable irrespective of the land use type (coefficient of variation > 100%). The results also showed that Ks was significantly higher (1.16-fold on average) under fallow compared to cropland. As for Kh, the results showed that, from −2 cm to zero tension heads (h), Kh under cropland and fallow is not significantly different; however, as the supplied tension decreases up to the saturation state, Kh under fallow becomes statistically higher compared to cropland. No significant difference was found between soil textures and bulk density under cropland and fallow meaning that the observed differences of Ks and Kh under cropland and fallow were caused by land use and not preexisting difference in texture. These results suggest an increasing risk of erosion, soil fertility reduction, and flood in the catchment because of agricultural land expansion.",

    "abstract": "In order to plan for global changing climate experiments are being conducted in many countries, but few have monitored the effects of the climate change treatments (warming, elevated CO2) on the experimental plot microclimate. During three years of an eight year study with year-round feedback-controlled infra-red heater warming (1.5/3.0°C day/night) and growing season free-air CO2 enrichment (600 ppm) in the mixed-grass prairie of Wyoming, USA, we monitored soil, leaf, canopy-air, above-canopy-air temperatures and relative humidity of control and treated experimental plots and evaluated ecologically important temperature differentials. Leaves were warmed somewhat less than the target settings (1.1 & 1.5°C day/night) but soil was warmed more creating an average that matched the target settings extremely well both during the day and night plus the summer and winter. The site typically has about 50% bare or litter covered soil, therefore soil heat transfer is more critical than in dense canopy ecosystems. The Wyoming site commonly has strong winds (5 ms(-1) average) and significant daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations (as much as 30°C daily) but the warming system was nearly always able to maintain the set temperatures regardless of abiotic variation. The within canopy-air was only slightly warmed and above canopy-air was not warmed by the system, therefore convective warming was minor. Elevated CO2 had no direct effect nor interaction with the warming treatment on microclimate. Relative humidity within the plant canopy was only slightly reduced by warming. Soil water content was reduced by warming but increased by elevated CO2. This study demonstrates the importance of monitoring the microclimate in manipulative field global change experiments so that critical physiological and ecological conclusions can be determined. Highly variable energy demand fluctuations showed that passive IR heater warming systems will not maintain desired warming for much of the time.",

    "abstract": "Labour exposure to heat stress driven by climate change will increase significantly with the rising global temperatures. Under heat stress, workers have to reduce work intensity and take longer breaks from work to prevent occupational illness and injuries. This study explores how the global warming and the resulting increase in heat stress can directly affect productivity of workers and indirectly impact upon the broader economy. Occupational statistics for 269 European regions are combined with daily heat stress indicator derived from a set of high-resolution climate scenarios. The novel approach, enabled by using a set of published exposure-response functions, assesses workers productivity losses differentiated by occupations. A macro econometric model of the European economy is then used to asses implications of change in productivity in monetary terms. The study finds that, compared to nowadays, productivity of labour can be 1.6% lower in Europe in 2080s, with a clear geographical gradient showing that southern and eastern regions are much more affected (e.g. up to 5.4% productivity loss in Greece). Furthermore, regions where the dominant occupations have relative lower earnings would also experience higher productivity loses. The analysis also focuses on the potential role of adaptation to reduce the productivity and economic losses, via air conditioning and a preliminary assessment of the potential of wearable robotics, which can reduce damages by 30%–40%.",

    "abstract": "Organic carbon content is one of the major proxies of aquatic primary production and implication of environmental changes. However, there is a scarcity of information regarding the decadal variation of organic carbon production in inner-shelf of South China Sea (SCS) and East China Sea (ECS). To bridge this gap of information two sediment cores were collected from the inner shelf of SCS (Leizhou Peninsula) and ECS. Then, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Total Inorganic Carbon (TIC) and Total Nitrogen (TN) content were examined. The TOC content in the Leizhou Peninsula averaged 0.56% and varied from 0.35% to 0.81%. At decadal time scale, the TOC content of Leizhou Peninsula erratically increased in the last century, and it distinctly peaked after 1990’s. This is related to increased primary production due to the increased input of anthropogenic nutrients and rainfall level. The TOC content of the inner shelf of ECS averaged 0.5% and varied narrowly from 0.46% to 0.53%. The TOC:TN ratio of ECS averaged 5.65 and varied from 4.42 to 7.85, indicating there is high degree of organic matter degradations. The TN:TP ratios were below 10 for the periods before late-1990’s, indicating that there had been a potential nitrogen limitation in the inner shelf of ECS. Generally, this study showed that the TOC and TIC of ECS and SCS inner-shelf had undergone substantial changes in the last century.",

Using the multistage sampling procedure, 152 respondents were selected and data were collected through the use of a structured interview schedule. Descriptive statistics, factor analysis and multiple linear regression model were used for the analysis. Results of the study show that all (100.0%) the respondents were aware of climate change, but lacked adequate knowledge of key climate change issues. The multiple linear regression model revealed a significant influence of years of formal education (t= 2.020; p=0.045), membership of social organizations (t=2.385; p=0.019) number of climate change training (t= -2.438; p=0.016), farm size (t=2.564; p=0.011), and access to credit (t=2.833; p=0.005) on the respondentsâ€™ level of knowledge on climate change. The information needs on climate change as perceived by farmers were: use of improved varieties (M=1.80), occupational diversification (M=1.78), and change in timing of farm operations (M=1.76), among others. The study therefore recommends that farmers should be taught climate change adaptation and mitigation measures using languages they can understand and in a participatory manner so as to enable them cope with the challenges of climate change.Â",

    "abstract": "Climate change-induced precipitation variability is the leading cause of rainfall erosivity that leads to excessive soil losses in most countries of the world. In this paper, four global climate models (GCMs) were used to characterize the spatiotemporal prediction of rainfall erosivity and assess the effect of variations of rainfall erosivity in Central Asia. The GCMs (BCCCSM1-1, IPSLCM5BLR, MIROC5, and MPIESMLR) were statistically downscaled using the delta method under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5 for two time periods: “Near” and “Far” future (2030s and 2070s). These GCMs data were used to estimate rainfall erosivity and its projected changes over Central Asia. WorldClim data was used as the present baseline precipitation scenario for the study area. The rainfall erosivity (R) factor of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was used to determine rainfall erosivity. The results show an increase in the future periods of the annual rainfall erosivity compared to the baseline. For all GCMs, with an average change in rainfall erosivity of about 5.6% (424.49 MJ mm ha−1 h−1 year−1) in 2030s and 9.6% (440.57 MJ mm ha−1 h−1 year−1) in 2070s as compared to the baseline of 402 MJ mm ha−1 h−1 year−1. The magnitude of the change varies with the GCMs, with the largest change being 26.6% (508.85 MJ mm ha−1 h−1 year−1), occurring in the MIROC-5 RCP8.5 scenario in the 2070s. Although annual rainfall erosivity shows a steady increase, IPSLCM5ALR (both RCPs and periods) shows a decrease in the average erosivity. Higher rainfall amounts were the prime causes of increasing spatial-temporal rainfall erosivity.",
