    "abstract": "Leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by vegetation are two of the essential biophysical variables used in most global models of climate, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology. Most LAI/FPAR products are retrieved from non-geostationary satellite observations. Long revisit times and cloud/cloud shadow contamination lead to temporal and spatial gaps in such LAI/FPAR products. For more effective use in monitoring of vegetation phenology, climate change impacts, disaster trend etc., in a timely manner, it is critical to generate LAI/FPAR with less cloud/cloud shadow contamination and at higher temporal resolution—something that is feasible with geostationary satellite data. In this paper, we estimate the geostationary Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) LAI/FPAR fields by training artificial neural networks (ANNs) with Himawari-8 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI/FPAR products for each biome type. Daily cycles of the estimated AHI LAI/FPAR products indicate that these are stable at 10-min frequency during the day. Comprehensive evaluations were carried out for the different biome types at different spatial and temporal scales by utilizing the MODIS LAI/FPAR products and the available field measurements. These suggest that the generated Himawari-8 AHI LAI/FPAR fields were spatially and temporally consistent with the benchmark MODIS LAI/FPAR products. We also evaluated the AHI LAI/FPAR products for their potential to accurately monitor the vegetation phenology—the results show that AHI LAI/FPAR products closely match the phenological development captured by the MODIS products.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the impacts of climate change on streamflow in the data-scarce Upper Ruvu River watershed (URRW). The Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) was employed for generating the future ensemble-mean climate scenario based on six global circulation models (GCMs), under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The future projections were made in two periods (2041–2060 and 2081–2100), and the baseline period (1951–1978) was used as a reference. The watershed hydrology was represented by the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model, which was calibrated and validated by using 5 and 4 years of streamflow data, respectively. Results indicate that the rainfall and minimum and maximum temperatures will increase in both periods, under both scenarios. This will potentially affect the streamflow that is projected to increase from March to August and decrease from September to February. The mean annual streamflow could potentially change from 48 m3/s in the baseline period to 45.6 and 56.5 m3/s during 2041–2060, and 52.4 and 67.4 m3/s during 2081–2100, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. The minimum and maximum streamflows are also predicted to change in both periods, under both scenarios. Considering these results, the climate change will have significant impacts on the streamflows of the URRW. HIGHLIGHTS The climate change impacts on streamflow were assessed in two future periods (2050s and 2080s) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.; The rainfall and temperature are projected to increase in both periods under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.; The climate change will have significant impacts on the streamflow of the Upper Ruvu River watershed.;",

    "abstract": "Many models are designed to generate future predictions under climate-change scenarios. Such models are typically calibrated for a study area with climate data that represent historical conditions. However, future projections of the model may include outputs for which the model has not been calibrated. Ideally, a climate-change-impacts model would be calibrated for recent conditions and also for possible future climate conditions. We demonstrate an approach, where a vegetation model is subjected to two calibrations: conventionally to the study area and separately to the study area plus additional areas representing analogues of potential future climate. We apply the dynamic vegetation model MC2 to a mountainous ecosystem in the Pacific Northwest, USA. We compare the conventional model calibration with the extra-study-area calibration and future projections. The two calibrations produce different outputs in key ecosystem variables, where some differences vary with time. Some model output trends for net primary productivity and plant functional type are more influenced by climatic input, while for others, the calibration area has greater consequence. Excluding areas representing potential future climate may be an important omission in model calibration, making the inclusion of such areas a decisive consideration in climate-change-impact simulations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Monitoring land use change dynamics is critical for tackling food security, climate change, and biodiversity loss on a global scale. This study is designed to classify land use and land cover in the upper Blue Nile River Basin (BNRB) using a random forest (RF) algorithm. The Landsat images for Landsat 45, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 are used for classification purposes. The study area is classified into seven land use/land cover classes: cultivated lands, bare lands, built‐ups, forests, grazing lands, shrublands, and waterbodies. The accuracy of classified images is 83%, 85%, and 91% using the Kappa index of agreements. From 1983 to 2022 periods, cultivated lands and built‐up areas increased by 47541 and 1777 km2, respectively, at the expense of grazing lands, shrublands, and forests. Furthermore, the area of water bodies has increased by 662 km2 due to the construction of small and large‐scale irrigation and hydroelectric power generation dams. The main factors that determine agricultural land expansion are related to population growth. Therefore, land use and land cover change detection using a random forest is an important technique for multispectral satellite data classification to understand the optimal use of natural resources, conservation practices, and decision‐making for sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mediterranean‐type ecosystems are under chronic ecological stress. By assessing changes in plant species and functional groups across the landscape, identifying ecosystem degradation is possible. The Santa Monica Mountains are in close proximity to a densely populated urban area where non‐native species invasions are being driven by changing fire regimes, climate change, and anthropogenic disturbances. Non‐native growth impacts biodiversity levels and vegetation distributions of native plant communities that are critical for ecosystem health. This study uses analyses of line‐point data from the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Program to assess ecosystem health in the Santa Monica Mountains from 2014 to 2020 and, in particular, to assess the effects of the 2018 Woolsey Fire on the balance of native and non‐native species in the region. Results of this analysis show an increase in non‐native cover since 2014 and rapid regrowth of non‐native annual grasses and herbaceous cover after the 2018 Woolsey Fire while native communities regrew more slowly. A hotspot of non‐native cover was identified in the Northern Simi Hills region, and rapid regrowth was seen after the Woolsey Fire. The hotspot is dominated by non‐native annual grasses and annual herbaceous species, some of which returned to prefire populations within a year after the Woolsey Fire. These results raise concerns for the future of native vegetation composition and function throughout the park and highlight the damage densely populated non‐native plant communities accumulate in the wake of disturbance events.",

    "abstract": "Pine wilt disease (PWD), caused by Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is one of the most severe forest diseases worldwide. PWD causes devastating disasters to Chinese pine trees, seriously threatening forestry production and the forest ecological environment, and causes economic losses of over ten billion yuan per year to China. Previous studies have shown that the spread of PWD is closely related to climate factors. Today, PWD is spreading rapidly owing to abnormal climate changes. In order to provide a reference for controlling the spread of PWD in China, in this study, we accurately assessed the risk of the continued spread of PWD in Northeast China; a correlative species distribution model (MaxEnt) (RM = 1, AUC = 0.9904) was used to evaluate China’s climate suitability for PWD. The effects of climate factors on the spread of PWD in Northeast China were studied using Liaoning Province as an example by analyzing the relationship between the changes in average precipitation, average temperature, average relative humidity, average vapor pressure deficit, average wind speed, average sunshine duration and the area of the PWD epidemic over the past five years. These results suggest that with the change in climate, the areas suitable for PWD have expanded, and certain previously unsuitable areas for its distribution have become suitable. Temperature and precipitation were found to play key roles in the occurrence and damage of PWD, and hot and arid conditions favored the spread of PWD. It is recommended that for areas within the suitable range of PWD but not yet epidemic areas, quarantine should be strengthened to prevent the further spread of PWD. In addition, special attention should be paid to epidemic areas with high temperatures and arid while the monitoring of PWD should be strengthened to achieve the early detection and timely treatment of infected epidemic trees. Our results indicate that PWD undoubtedly poses a major threat to Northeast Chinese pine species if climate change proceeds as projected. In the future, more attention should be paid to monitoring the northward spread of PWD, and further studies should consider meteorological data forecasts, which could facilitate timely control measures.",

    "abstract": "Critical hydrometeorological events are generally triggered by heavy precipitation. In complex terrain, precipitation may be perturbed by the upslope raising of the incoming humid airflow, causing in some cases extreme rainfall. In this work, the application of LUME—Linear Upslope Model Extension—to a group of extreme events that occurred across mountainous areas of the Central Alps and Apennines in Italy is presented. Based on the previous version, the model has been “extended” in some aspects, proposing a methodology for physically estimating the time-delay coefficients as a function of precipitation efficiency. The outcomes of LUME are encouraging for the cases studied, revealing the intensification of precipitation due to the orographic effect. A comparison between the reference rain gauge data and the results of the simulations showed good agreement. Since extreme precipitation is expected to increase due to climate change, especially across the Mediterranean region, LUME represents an effective tool to investigate more closely how these extreme phenomena originate and evolve in mountainous areas that are subject to potential hydrometeorological risks.",
