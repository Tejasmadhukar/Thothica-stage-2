    "abstract": "This study addresses the role of human-induced climate change on the interactions of convective activities between the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and western North Pacific (WNP) regions - an important scientific issue which has been hitherto overlooked. We have examined this problem using two numerical experiments of a high-resolution climate model, with and without anthropogenic forcing (i.e., HIST and HISTNAT) for the historical period 1951–2005, supplemented by innovative diagnostics like causal network analysis. Our findings suggest that an anthropogenically-forced weakening of the ISM circulation tends to significantly enhance the genesis potential index (GPI) of the WNP tropical cyclones by 13.5% and associated convective activities, by reorienting the large-scale flow over the tropical Indo-Pacific in a manner that is conducive for enhancement of the WNP tropical cyclogenesis. Additionally, it is found that the probability of extremely low sea-level pressure (SLP) (<995.5 hPa) around Taiwan and Chinese mainland is significantly higher by 10.3% in the anthropogenically-forced simulation as compared to the natural run. Using the model outputs from HIST and HISTNAT, we also performed a causal effect network (CEN) analysis to understand the causal connections among the three indices involved in the ISM-WNP interactions (a) Indian monsoon circulation index (IMI) which is the difference in the area-averaged 850 hPa zonal winds between the boxes (40oE-80oE, 5oN-15oN) and (70oE-90oE, 20oN-30oN) (b) WNP tropical cyclone activity expressed as the genesis potential index (GPI) averaged over the region (120oE-180oE, 5oN-30oN) and (c) Tropical Indo-Pacific wind index (IPWND) which is based on the 850 hPa zonal winds averaged over the domain (100oE-130oE, 5oN-20oN). Results from the CEN analysis indicate that an anthropogenically-forced weakening of the IMI can lead to possible strengthening of GPI and IPWND with time-lags of 5 and 7 days, respectively. In general, it is noted that the causal relationships among IMI, GPI and IPWND are associated with shorter time-lags (∼4–9 days) in HIST and longer time-lags (∼19–28 days) in HISTNAT.",

In this study, we present a modeling framework that allows one to quantify of the impact of climate change and variations in vacation absence on the peaking factor for specific geographic regions. The framework consists of a support vector regression model that simulates daily water demand as a function of meteorological parameters and vacation absence, coupled to an extreme value model that translates simulation results to a peaking factor. After initial model development, we simulated the effects of different climate change/vacation scenarios for 2050 on eight water supply areas in the Netherlands and Belgium. We found that on average there is a net increase in water demand of 0.8% in 2050 and a 6.5% increase in peak demand compared to the reference period.",

    "abstract": "Human activities are changing ecosystems at an unprecedented rate, yet large-scale studies into how local human impacts alter natural systems and interact with other aspects of global change are still lacking. Here we provide empirical evidence that local human impacts fundamentally alter relationships between ecological communities and environmental drivers. Using tropical coral reefs as a study system, we investigated the influence of contrasting levels of local human impact using a spatially extensive dataset spanning 62 outer reefs around inhabited Pacific islands. We tested how local human impacts (low versus high determined using a threshold of 25 people km−2 reef) affected benthic community (i) structure, and (ii) relationships with environmental predictors using pre-defined models and model selection tools. Data on reef depth, benthic assemblages, and herbivorous fish communities were collected from field surveys. Additional data on thermal stress, storm exposure, and market gravity (a function of human population size and reef accessibility) were extracted from public repositories. Findings revealed that reefs subject to high local human impact were characterised by relatively more turf algae (>10% higher mean absolute coverage) and lower live coral cover (9% less mean absolute coverage) than reefs subject to low local human impact, but had similar macroalgal cover and coral morphological composition. Models based on spatio-physical predictors were significantly more accurate in explaining the variation of benthic assemblages at sites with low (mean adjusted-R2 = 0.35) rather than high local human impact, where relationships became much weaker (mean adjusted-R2 = 0.10). Model selection procedures also identified a distinct shift in the relative importance of different herbivorous fish functional groups in explaining benthic communities depending on the local human impact level. These results demonstrate that local human impacts alter natural systems and indicate that projecting climate change impacts may be particularly challenging at reefs close to higher human populations, where dependency and pressure on ecosystem services are highest.",

While decreases in annual and seasonal rainfall totals have also been observed, this alone does not seem to explain the observed reduction in flow. In this study, we investigate the large-scale climate drivers for Victoria and demonstrate how these modulate the regional scale synoptic patterns, which in turn alter the way seasonal rainfall totals are compiled and the amount of runoff per unit rainfall that is produced. The hydrological implications are significant and illustrate the need for robust hydrological modelling, that takes into account insights into physical mechanisms that drive regional hydroclimatology, in order to properly understand and quantify the impacts of climate change (natural and/or anthropogenic) on water resources.",

Animal diversity, both inter- and intra-species, has multiple socio-economic attributes. In an agroecosystem with uncultivated land, cultivated land, livestock and households as the integral components, livestock play crucial role in transferring nutrients from ecologically more sustainable ecosystem (forest/ rangeland/ grassland) to ecologically vulnerable one (cultivated land), and in the recycling of nutrients in the cultivated lands. Draught animal power (DAP) is a key source for realizing sustainability in traditional agricultural systems which is ensured by their role in enhancing ecological processesâ€”cropping diversification, agro-biodiversity maintenance, and soil fertility management. Farm animals also play negative role leading to environmental degradation through overgrazing and carbon emissions. Grazing animals significantly affect an ecosystem in triple ways, viz. herbivory, physical effects, and deposition. Overgrazing alters community structure as well as ecosystem functioning, including primary productivity and it has triggering effects on an ecosystem. Farm animals are key agents as well as sufferers of the on-going climate change. Their role in land degradation, water pollution, biodiversity erosion and release of GHGs contributes to exacerbate global warming.",

    "abstract": "In the context of climate and environmental change assessment, the use of probabilistic models in which the parameters of a given distribution may vary in accordance with time has reinforced the need for appropriate procedures to recognize the “statistical significance” of trends in data series arising from stochastic processes. This paper introduces a parametric methodology, which exploits a measure based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AICΔ), and a Rescaled version of the Generalized Extreme Value distribution, in which a linear deterministic trend in the position parameter is accounted for. A Monte Carlo experiment was set up with the generation of nonstationary synthetic series characterized by different sample lengths and covering a wide range of the shape and scale parameters. The performances of statistical tests based on the parametric AICΔ and the non-parametric Mann-Kendall measures were evaluated and compared with reference to observed ranges of annual maxima of precipitation, peak flow, and wind speed. Results allow for sensitivity analysis of the test power and show a strong dependence on the trend coefficient and the L-Coefficient of Variation of the parent distribution from the upper-bounded to the heavy-tailed special cases. An analysis of the sample variability of the position parameter is also presented, based on the same generation sets.",

This work uses bias-adjusted Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase six (CMIP6) model datasets to investigate the future changes in temperature extremes over Mediterranean (MED) and Sahara (SAH) regions. The mid- (2041–2070) and far-future (2071–2100) are studied under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways: SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Quantile mapping function greatly improved the performance of CMIP6 by reducing the notable biases to match the distribution of observation data, the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). Results show persistent significant warming throughout the 21st century, increasing with the increase in radiative forcing. The MED will record a higher increase in temperature extremes as compared to SAH. The warming is supported by the projected reduction in cold days (TX10p) and cold nights (TN10p), with the reduction in the number of cold nights exceeding cold days. Notably, warm spell duration index (WSDI) and summer days (SU) have a positive trend in both timelines over the entire study area. There is a need to simulate how climate sensitive sectors, such as water and agriculture, are likely to be affected by projected changes under different scenarios for informed decision making in the choice and implementation of adaptation and mitigation effective measures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Global ocean oxygen loss is projected to persist in the future, but Earth system models (ESMs) have not yet provided a consistent picture of how it will influence the largest oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the tropical Pacific. We examine the change in the Pacific OMZ volume in an ensemble of ESMs from the CMIP6 archive, considering a broad range of oxygen (O2) thresholds relevant to biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems (5–160 µmol/kg). Despite OMZ biases in the historical period of the simulations, the ESM ensemble projections consistently fall into three regimes across ESMs: an expansion of low oxygenated waters (+0.8 [0.6, 1.0] × 1016 m3/century for O2 ≤ 120 µmol/kg, ESM median and interquartile range); a slight contraction of the OMZ core although more uncertain across ESMs (−0.1 [−0.5, 0.0] × 1016 m3/century for O2 ≤ 20 µmol/kg); and at the transition from contraction to expansion regimes, a spatial redistribution but near‐zero change in the volume of hypoxic waters (0.0 [−0.3, +0.1] × 1016 m3/century for O2 ≤ 60 µmol/kg). Changes in circulation and biology dictate the shift from expansion to contraction. Specifically, reduced subtropical ventilation controls the expansion of low oxygenated waters, while a combination of circulation and biological changes explains the contraction of the core (likely changes in mixing, reduced intermediate ventilation and oxygen demand). Increased model complexity (e.g., ecosystem dynamics and equatorial circulation) likely stabilize the OMZ response, suggesting that future changes might lie in the lower bound of current projections. The expansion of low oxygenated waters which delimit the optimum habitat of numerous marine species would severely impact ecosystems and ecosystem services.",

    "abstract": "The development of high-yielding, bio-fortified, stress-tolerant crop cultivars is the need of the hour in the wake of increasing global food insecurity, abrupt climate change, and continuous shrinking of resources and landmass suitable for agriculture. The cytokinin group of phytohormones positively regulates seed yield by simultaneous regulation of source capacity (leaf senescence) and sink strength (grain number and size). Cytokinins also regulate root-shoot architecture by promoting shoot growth and inhibiting root growth. Cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) are the only enzymes that catalyze the irreversible degradation of active cytokinins and thus negatively regulate the endogenous cytokinin levels. Genetic manipulation of CKX genes is the key to improve seed yield and root-shoot architecture through direct manipulation of endogenous cytokinin levels. Downregulation of CKX genes expressed in sink tissues such as inflorescence meristem and developing seeds, through reverse genetics approaches such as RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in increased yield marked by increased number and size of grains. On the other hand, root-specific expression of CKX genes resulted in decreased endogenous cytokinin levels in roots which in turn resulted in increased root growth indicated by increased root branching, root biomass, and root-shoot biomass ratio. Enhanced root growth provided enhanced tolerance to drought stress and improved micronutrient uptake efficiency. In this review, we have emphasized the role of CKX as a genetic factor determining yield, micronutrient uptake efficiency, and response to drought stress. We have summarised the efforts made to increase crop productivity and drought stress tolerance in different crop species through genetic manipulation of CKX family genes.",
