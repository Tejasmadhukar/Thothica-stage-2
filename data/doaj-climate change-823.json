    "abstract": "We usually reject information from sources we dislike. But what if those same sources explicitly disagree with that information? Are we more likely to be persuaded by information that is opposed by someone we dislike? We present results from an experimental study with a convenience sample of 199 Dutch students. Respondents were exposed to counter-attitudinal information on climate change in an attempt to generate persuasion, and in a second time exposed to a tweet from the current US president, Donald J. Trump, as a positive or negative endorsement of the counter-attitudinal. Results show that positive endorsements reduce the persuasive power of counter-attitudinal information, whereas negative endorsements (marginally) increase its persuasive power. These results have important implications in today’s politics, where “disliked” figures—most of the time referred to as “populists”—play an increasingly central role in framing the terms of the debate on the most salient issues.",

    "abstract": "Whereas global compacts, such as the Kyoto Protocol, have yet to consolidate action from governments on climate change, there has been increasing emphasis and acknowledgement of the role of individuals (as citizens and consumers) as contributors to climate change and as responsible agents in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, along with the acknowledgement of the threat that anthropogenic climate change presents to the planet, governments and non-government organizations have focused on personal responsibility campaigns targeting individuals and households with a view to stemming the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. The Australian Government, for example, spent $25 million in 2007 on the climate change information campaign targeted to every Australian household, ‘Be Climate Clever: “I can do that”. Such measures centre on “personal, private-sphere ….. behaviour” (Stern 2005: 10786) that focuses on the “choice of goods, services and lifestyles” (WWF-UK 2008: 10) and imply that global greenhouse gas emission reduction targets can be met through the actions of individuals. There is growing concern in some quarters about climate change programs that emphasize individual behaviour change strategies that use “simple and painless steps” (WWF-UK 2008) and “small steps add up” (Accountability and Consumers International 2007) approaches. The emergent fear is that given the urgency of the climate change problem that such approaches will mean important opportunities for citizen-led action will be lost. This paper will explore how notions of individual responsibility have arisen and what the trend towards individualized responsibility may mean for active citizenship on climate change.",

    "abstract": "The current literature on climate services for farmers predominantly focuses on seasonal forecasts, with an assumption that longer-term climate projections may not be suitable for informing farming decisions. In this paper, we explore whether certain types of long-term climate projections may be useful for some specific types of farming decisions. Through interviews with almond tree crop farmers and farm advisors in California, we examine how farmers perceive the utility and accuracy levels of long-term climate projections and identify the types of projections that they may find useful. The interviews revealed that farmers often perceive long-term climate projections as an extension of weather forecasts, which can lead to their initial skepticism of the utility of such information. However, we also found that when farmers were presented with long-term trends or shifts in crop-specific agroclimatic metrics (such as chill hours or summer heat), they immediately perceived these as valuable for their decision-making. Hence, the manner in which long-term projections are framed, presented, and discussed with farmers can heavily influence their perception of the potential utility of such projections. The iterative conversations as part of the exploratory interview questions, served as a tool for “joint construction of meaning” of complex and ambiguous terms such as “long-term climate projections,” “long-term decisions” and “uncertainty.” This in-turn supported a joint identification (and understanding) of the types of information that can potentially be useful for on-farm adaptive decisions, where the farmer and the interviewer both improvise and iterate to find the best types of projections that fit specific decision-contexts. Overall, this research identifies both the types of long-term climate information that farmers may consider useful, and the engagement processes that are able to effectively elicit farmers' long-term information needs.",

    "abstract": "The regional climate impacts of hypothetical future emissions scenarios can be estimated by combining Earth system model simulations with a linear pattern scaling model such as MESMER (Modular Earth System Model Emulator with spatially Resolved output), which uses estimated patterns of the local response per degree of global temperature change. Here we use the mean trend component of MESMER to emulate the regional pattern of the surface temperature response based on historical single-forcer and future Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) simulations. Errors in the emulations for selected target scenarios (SSP1–1.9, SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0, and SSP5–8.5) are decomposed into two components, namely (1) the differences in scaling patterns between scenarios as a consequence of varying combinations of external forcings and (2) the intrinsic time series differences between the local and global responses in the target scenario. The time series error is relatively small for high-emissions scenarios, contributing around 20 % of the total error, but is similar in magnitude to the pattern error for lower-emissions scenarios. This irreducible time series error limits the efficacy of linear pattern scaling for emulating strong mitigation pathways and reduces the dependence on the predictor pattern used. The results help guide the choice of predictor scenarios for simple climate models and where to target for the introduction of other dependent variables beyond global surface temperature into pattern scaling models.",

    "abstract": "California growers in the San Joaquin Valley believe that climate change will affect the pistachio yield dramatically. As the central valley fog disappears, insufficient dormant chill accumulation results in poor flowering synchrony, flower quality, and fruit set in this dioecious species. We have developed a novel, user-friendly, and low-cost Voice-Controlled Wireless Solid Set Canopy Delivery (VCW-SSCD) system to increase bud chill accumulation with evaporative cooling on sunny (winter) days. This system includes: (i) an automated solid-state canopy delivery (SSCD) system; (ii) a wireless weather-, crop-related data acquisition system; (iii) a Voice-Controlled (VC) system using Amazon Alexa; (iv) a mobile application to visualize the collected data and wirelessly control the SSCD system; and (v) a smart control system. The proposed system was deployed and evaluated in a commercial pistachio orchard in Bakersfield, CA. The system worked well with no reported errors. Results demonstrated the system’s ability to cool bud temperatures in a low relative humidity climate. At an ambient temperature of 10–20 °C, bud temperatures were lowered 5–10 °C.",

    "abstract": "Owing to global warming, extreme precipitation events in the arid regions of Central Asia have increased, resulting in significant consequences for water resources and ecosystems. Hence, to address the features and corresponding physical mechanisms of these rainstorms, we examined the rainstorm that occurred in Hotan, Xinjiang in June 2021 as a case study. We employed multiple datasets, including meteorological stations, sounding observations, satellite precipitation data, and reanalysis datasets. The results indicate that the Global Precipitation Measurement satellite precipitation product accurately captured the temporal and spatial variations in this rainstorm, as verified against hourly in situ observation data. Some meteorological stations recorded values greater than twice their historical records, such as Luopu, Pishan, Moyu, and Hotan. Moreover, the duration of the precipitation was longer than 2 days. For the physical mechanisms of this rainstorm, the water vapor in this rainstorm is sourced from the 45°–65°N region of the North Atlantic Ocean crosses the Ural Mountains and the West Siberian Plain to southern Xinjiang. The low-pressure levels (e.g., 700 hPa and 850 hPa) have the more water vapor flux and specific humidity than the high-pressure levels. Our findings can aid the understanding of extreme precipitation events in Central Asia and provide a reference for dealing with meteorological disasters, including extreme precipitation, in the context of global climate change.",

This will allow the company's managers to understand the trend of climate change and how to influence the company in the future against the background of these problems. Studies show the negative consequences of climate change and the forms of their manifestation, which threaten the investment attractiveness of the enterprise. The main ones are: instability of temperature indicators in the field of water resources, soil degradation and the spread of diseases and pests of crops. The task of adapting Kernel agroholding to the new conditions of agricultural business taking into account the conditions of climate change is proposed.",

The purpose of this study was to explore the relative importance of snow microbial processing of C, N, and P compounds in atmospheric deposition and litter and detect elemental limitations of snow microbes in Rocky Mountain conifer forests. Enzyme activity in snow was orders of magnitude greater than activity reported for lentic and lotic waters in similar environments. Proportions of C/P‐ and C/N‐acquiring enzymes suggest that snow samples were P limited, or C and P co‐limited, while lentic and lotic waters were more N limited. As such, microbes in seasonal snow may change the composition of nutrients and carbon, but these processes are vulnerable to changes in atmospheric deposition and snow extent and duration, which could affect nutrient processing across large areas.",

    "abstract": "Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a fundamental tool for evaluating the environmental and energy load of a production cycle. Its application to renewable energy production systems offers the possibility of identifying the environmental benefits of such processes—especially those related to the by-products of production processes (i.e., digestion or biochar). Biochar has received worldwide interest because of its potential uses in bioenergy production, due to its coproducts (bio-oil and syngas), as well as in global warming mitigation, sustainable agriculture, pollutant removal, and other uses. Biochar production and use of soil is a strategy for carbon sequestration that could contribute to the reduction of emissions, providing simultaneous benefits to soil and opportunities for bioenergy generation. However, to confirm all of biochar’s benefits, it is necessary to characterize the environmental and energy loads of the production cycle. In this work, soil carbon sequestration, nitrous oxide emissions, use of fertilizers, and use of water for irrigation have been considered in the biochar’s LCA, where the latter is used as a soil conditioner. Primary data taken from experiments and prior studies, as well as open-source available databases, were combined to evaluate the environmental impacts of energy production from biomass, as well as the biochar life cycle, including pre- and post-conversion processes. From the found results, it can be deduced that the use of gasification production of energy and biochar is an attractive strategy for mitigating the environmental impacts analyzed here—especially climate change, with a net decrease of about −8.3 × 103 kg CO2 eq. Finally, this study highlighted strategic research developments that combine the specific characteristics of biochar and soil that need to be amended.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the importance of renewable energy as a complement to meeting the energy demand in Africa was investigated. In most African countries, the larger percentage of power generation is from fossil fuel-based energy sources, and without a doubt, this can be complemented with renewable energy to meet the demand per country and the global interest on climate change. Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana and South Africa are among the leading African countries that are blessed with an abundance of renewable energy resources, which have the potentials to improve their respective energy generation potentials; thereby, contributing to the socio-economic growth, promote industrialization, reduce global warming and create green jobs. Despite the abundant renewable energy sources in these countries, they are yet to fully harness the potentials, therefore, resulting in their deficiencies in contributing to the electrical power generation per country. The bulk of the problems associated with renewable energy in African countries are: little interest and lopsided policy on renewable energy, enforcing existing policies, high renewable energy tariff, and lack of adequate infrastructure. The current study discusses the ways by which conscious decisions and policy of governments, alongside the stakeholders’ dedication can ensure sustainable energy supplies. Based on the findings of the study, renewable energy-based power generation can greatly reduce greenhouse gases. Also, subsidizing the tariff levied on renewable can promote energy generation leading to job creation through energy generation from renewable resources.",
