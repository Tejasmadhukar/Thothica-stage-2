    "abstract": "Changing climatic conditions are an increasing threat to cotton production worldwide. There is a need to develop multiple stress-tolerant cotton germplasms that can adapt to a wide range of environments. For this purpose, 30 cotton genotypes were evaluated for two years under drought (D), heat (H), and drought + heat stresses (DH) under field conditions. Results indicated that plant height, number of bolls, boll weight, seed cotton yield, fiber fineness, fiber strength, fiber length, K+, K+/Na+, relative water contents (RWC), chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, and total soluble proteins got reduced under D and H and were lowest under DH, whereas superoxidase dismutase (SOD), H2O2, Na+, GOT%, total phenolic contents, ascorbate, and flavonoids got increased for consecutive years. Correlation studies indicated that there was a positive correlation between most of the traits, but a negative correlation with H2O2 and Na+ ions. PCA and clustering analysis indicated that MNH-786, KAHKSHAN, CEMB-33, MS-71, FH-142, NIAB-820, CRS-2007, and FH-312 consistently performed better than other genotypes for most traits under stress conditions. Identified genotypes can be utilized in the future cotton breeding program to develop high-yielding, climate change-resilient cotton.",

    "abstract": "Pension funds have become major targets for the incorporation of climate change into their investment decisions. Recently, divestment from carbon intensive companies or industries has been the object of a wave of campaigns directed at these institutional investors. This paper uses Foucault’s dispositive of security to investigate the decisions of one organization, the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which in 2021 divested from seven oil sands companies. Conceptualizing divestment within a security dispositive helps us build theory which understands divestment within existing security-oriented arrangements. It shows how changes build upon the existing dispositive, and that by looking to existing governing arrangements we can see elements that act as operators to change their direction and emphasis. In the case of pension fund divestment, risk is the operator that both sustains the investment function and also tilts the arrangement towards climate change. In these existing arrangements lay the ingredients for future social relations.",

    "abstract": "Climatic variations of the last few millennia can reveal patterns of variability beyond that recorded by the instrumental record. In this study we use pollen and sediments to generate a high resolution 3000 year record of vegetation and climate along the southern California coast. An increase in Pinus and Quercus pollen found in the top 100 years of the record is a result of known planting and fire suppression by the forest service. In the pre-historic record, a period of high Salix percentages and high pollen concentration from 500-250 cal yr BP represents the wettest period of the record and coincides with the Little Ice Age. We also find evidence for 3 warm periods between 1350 and 650 cal yr BP which are identified in the record by the presence of Pediastrum boryanum var. boryanum. The latter two of these periods, dating from 1070-900 and 700–650 cal yr BP correspond to Medieval Climatic Anomaly droughts identified in other records. In addition to these events, we identify a multi-centennial scale drought between 2700 and 2000 cal yr BP in Zaca Lake, corroborating evidence from across the Great Basin and extending the regional spread of this multi-centennial drought to southern California. Corresponding wetter conditions in the northwest indicate that the modern ENSO precipitation dipole also occurred during this persistent drought. Today this dipole is associated with La Niña conditions and we note a coincidence with intriguing evidence for a change in ENSO dynamics from marine records in the tropical Pacific. This dry period is remarkably persistent and has important implications for understanding the possible durations of drought conditions in the past in California.",

Initially, a commitment of $100 million dedicated to build urban resilience was made by the Foundation (the commitment has now gone up to $164 million). With this initiative, 100 Resilient Cities supports cities in building a Resilience Strategy aimed at identifying the main risks they are facing and the best way to tackle them. To help cities drive transformation, 100 Resilient Cities has set up different tools from financial to technical support. The initiative encourages cities to hire a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) who is the single point of contact within a city’s government. The CRO’s mission is to both deliver the Resilience Strategy of a city by assessing risks and to monitor implementation of the plan. Today, 40 resilience strategies have been set up through 100 Resilient Cities with 90 Chief Resilience Officers in place in cities.",

    "abstract": "Flash flood is one of the extremely destructive natural disasters in the world. In recent years, extreme rainfall events caused by global climate change have increased, and flash flood disasters are becoming the main types of natural disasters in the world. Due to the characteristics of strong suddenness, complex disaster-causing factors, great difficulty in prediction and forecast, and the lack of historical data, it is difficult to effectively prevent and control flash flood disaster. The early identification technology of flash floods is not only the basis of flash flood disaster prediction and early warning, but also an effective means of flash flood prevention and control. The paper makes a meta-analysis and visual analysis of 475 documents collected by the Web of Science Document Platform in the past 31 years by comprehensively using Citespace, Vosviewer, Origin, etc. We systematically summarize the research progress and development trend of early identification technology of flash flood disasters from five key research subfields: (1) precipitation, (2) sediment, (3) sensitivity analysis, (4) risk assessment, (5) uncertainty analysis. In addition, we analyze and discuss the main problems encountered in the current research of several subfields and put forward some suggestions to provide references for the prevention and control of flash flood disasters.",

    "abstract": "Climate change-related threats and land insecurities are increasingly impacting upon disadvantaged communities, especially women. In the context of evolving land policy discourse and priorities, intertwined land tenure, climate change, and gender equality require reference to global normative human rights and development frameworks. Human Rights treaties, the Paris Agreement, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the New Urban Agenda, among others have strategic policy implications. While professionals focus on land use planning, management, administration policy tools, climate change activists rely on a range of advocacy, mobilization and ‘justice’ approaches. For example, women’s rights and community groups have increasingly sought accountability through global human rights standards, environmental targets and enforceable gender equality norms. This article outlines how human rights play a vital role in these debates, seeking to mediate the tensions and synergies between competing approaches to land, climate and gender, despite gaps and inconsistencies which often frustrate their outcomes. Through human rights-based approaches (HRBAs) offer advocates for land rights, gender equality and climate action a hybrid, innovative and pragmatic platform to develop creative alliances with social justice and development partners to deliver incremental but tangible gender-responsive land and climate rights.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates the evolving concept of fiduciary duty and its role in Canadian public sector pension funds’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing practices. It contributes to the literature in the distinct but related fields of environmental gentrification and urban climate finance by bringing fiduciary debates into sharper focus. Engagement with issues surrounding investors’ legal and ethical duties to invest responsibly can contribute to an enhanced understanding of the global and local mechanisms of production and reproduction of environmental and spatial inequalities, as well as strategies for creating more than just urban futures. ESG, a calculative and modelling technique used to manage investment risks, overwhelmingly focuses on physical and financial climate risks (e.g., infrastructure assets and risks associated with regulatory change). This privileges the instrumental, Cartesian view of the environment as severed from its social, historical, and relational character, a perspective that has been thoroughly critiqued in the environmental/ecological gentrification literature. However, ESG investing has also introduced a potentially productive uncertainty in the realm of financial expertise; it forces questions about what it means to invest deferred compensation in the “best interests” of workers and retirees. This article has three interrelated aims. First, it reviews recent trends in environmental gentrification and urban climate finance literature to highlight an emerging but underdeveloped engagement with ESG and fiduciary duty. Second, it shows how the rise of ESG has revealed a vulnerability in the hegemonic profit maximization interpretation of fiduciary duty and invited further, open-ended, critical-theoretical engagements with the concept of the fiduciary and their responsibilities. Finally, it offers the concept of “fiduciary activism from below” to explore how grassroots agency increasingly stages a direct confrontation with corporations, institutional investors, and shareholders in the struggles over urban space and resistance to environmental and infrastructural violence.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable horticulture development is a priority area considering climate change, especially in the context of reduced water supply. The search for ways to regulate the resistance of fruit trees to stressors is an urgent issue for the world community. The use of beneficial microorganisms to inoculate plant roots helps reduce the use of synthetic substances and is an alternative for sustainable horticulture. The purpose of the study is to identify the specific features of the effect of root inoculation by mycorrhizal fungi on the reaction of sweet cherries to develop strategies for managing the production of fruit products. The study was conducted during 2018- 2020 in the sweet sweet cherry orchard of the southern steppe subzone of Ukraine. Such research methods as field, laboratory, biochemical, physiological, and statistical were used. The regularities of the influence of mycorrhizal fungi on the total moisture content and water-holding capacity of sweet cherry leaves were examined. In the first year of studies on endomycorrhizal root inoculation, these indicators were higher compared to the control group. The positive effect of endo-ectomycorrhiza on the waterholding capacity of sweet cherry leaves was elucidated. The total leaf surface and the content of green pigments in the leaves were determined as one of the main indicators of the photosynthetic potential of a fruit crop. The effect of inoculation of sweet cherry roots by mycorrhizal fungi on the ratio of chlorophylls (a/b) in leaves was established. The parameters of the content of total nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in sweet cherry leaves were determined. The use of mycorrhizal fungi increases the adaptive properties of sweet cherry trees to stressful factors, namely, arid conditions in the south of Ukraine. The research results can be used by fruit producers to improve climate-optimised technologies, which will substantially reduce risks and possible economic losses, and preserve biodiversity",

    "abstract": "Global governance has altered institutional architecture and the systemic and institutional conditions under which power is exercised, as well as the characteristics of the political system, the form of government, and the system of intermediation of interests. However, although it has surpassed the State’s dimension of power, it created new interstate dimensions and new relations between powers, particularly at the level of cities. Cities have helped to solve common problems in a more efficient and effective way by facilitating the exchange of knowledge, sharing of solutions and resources, and building capacity to implement and monitor progress in order to achieve collectively agreed goals, in a bottom-up approach. Cities have the virtue of securing the most direct social and political contract between societies and the notion of authority. This study, therefore, aims to reflect on this emerging, less hierarchical and rigid governance and address complex global challenges such as climate and demographic change; increasing crime rates; disruptive technology; and pressures on resources, infrastructure and energy. As a global/local interface, cities can ensure effective solutions to current challenges and act together in areas where the global agenda has stalled.",

To that end, it is of interest to deepen our understanding of the performance of half-warm mix asphalt (HWMA) manufactured with high proportions of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). Thus, in the present study, a laboratory analysis was carried out in which the behavior of HWMA manufactured with 100% RAP and without rejuvenators was compared with that of a control mix, i.e., an HWMA manufactured with 0% RAP. In particular, we analyzed the compaction energy with a gyratory compactor, mixing time and temperature, volumetric properties, moisture damage resistance through indirect tensile tests after immersion (ITS), stiffness based on the resilient modulus, resistance to permanent deformation using wheel tracking tests, and fatigue resistance through indirect tensile fatigue tests (ITFT). Both mixtures displayed adequate volumetric and mechanical properties, but the performance of the high-RAP HWMA was better than that of the control mixture in terms of resistance to permanent deformation in hot areas. In addition, the high-RAP HWMA without rejuvenators could provide energy and material savings, thus promoting sustainable development.",
