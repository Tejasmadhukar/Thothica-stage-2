The model was improved as a part of the Louisiana Coastal Master Plan of 2017 and is one of several linked models used to evaluate the potential effects of climate change and sea levels rise as well as the potential effects of alternative approaches to managing the region’s natural resources to mitigate the effects of sea level rise. The model we describe here incorporates a number of improvements over the previous version of the model developed for the 2012 Master Plan, including an expansion of the number of species and habitat types represented, the inclusion of bottomland forests and barrier islands, and the incorporation of additional ecological processes such as dispersal. Here, we present results from the model used to evaluate large scale ecosystem restoration projects, as well as three alternative management scenarios to illustrate the utility of the model and the ability of current management plans to address the threats that sea level rise pose to Louisiana’s coastal wetland ecosystems.",

Very little is understood about victims caught in the debate about climate change and forced movement. The New York Times, with its selective framing of the issue makes absent ideologically important factors that seem to alter the central story line of environmental migration. These absences are methodologically mapped using Stibbe’s (2015) conceptual tools of capturing erasure in texts in this paper. The argument that emerges from mapping these absences is that there is a categorical operational difference between erasure and absences. While erasure may be intentionally manipulative, absences offers elite newspapers a way forward to ignore issues that do not seem to be news-worthy for coverage. This way absence of coverage leads to absence of attention on the true victims of climate change.",

    "abstract": "The agricultural region of Marathwada in India incurred significant loss of crops and lives during the summer of 2015, which was characterised by persistent hot and dry conditions. We use observations and large ensembles of regional climate model simulations to understand and attribute this joint occurrence of deficient rainfall and high temperature in a novel, multivariate framework. Highly unlikely in a world without anthropogenic climate change (1-in-256 year), the event is found to be frequent (1-in-38 year) in the actual world. Thus, the risk of this event is found to be atleast quintupled due to anthropogenic factors, implying that the 2015 event is more likely due to anthropogenic climate change. Interestingly, the 2015 dry event is not unprecedented (∼1-in-15 year) based on observed records and for either of the model scenarios, suggesting that risk assessments based on rainfall alone may not be enough to reconcile the observed impacts. Further, such compound drought events are projected to become even more frequent under future end-of-the-century warming targets of 1.5 °C and 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, with expected doubling and tripling of the probability of the 2015 hot-dry conditions, respectively. Our findings highlight the role of human-induced warming on increased incidences of compound extreme events, thereby warranting adaptation strategies that aim at alleviating associated risks.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide tree mortality as induced by climate change presents a challenge to forest managers. To successfully manage vulnerable forests requires the capacity of regeneration to compensate for losses from tree mortality. We observed rapid regeneration and the growth release of young trees after warming-induced mortality in a David aspen-dominated (Populus davidiana) broad-leaved forest in Inner Mongolia, China, as based on individual tree measurements taken in 2012 and 2015 from a 6-ha permanent plot. Warming and drought stress killed large trees 10-15 m tall with a total number of 2881 trees during 2011-2012, and also thinned the upper crowns. David aspen recruitment increased 2 times during 2012-2015 and resulted in a high transition probability of David aspen replacing the same or other species, whereas the recruitment of Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica) was much lower: it decreased from 2012 to 2015, indicating that rapid regeneration represented a regrowth phase for David aspen, and not succession to Mongolian oak. Further, we found that the recruitment density increased with canopy openness, thus implying that warming-induced mortality enhanced regeneration. Our results suggest that David aspen has a high regrowth ability to offset individual losses from warming-induced mortality. This important insight has implications for managing this vulnerable forest in the semi-arid region of northern China.",

    "abstract": "Reliable projections of extremes by climate models are becoming increasingly important in the context of climate change and associated societal impacts. Extremes are by definition rare events, characterized by a small sample associated with large uncertainties. The evaluation of extreme events in model simulations thus requires performance measures that compare full distributions rather than simple summaries. This paper proposes the use of the integrated quadratic distance (IQD) for this purpose. The IQD is applied to evaluate CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations of monthly maximum and minimum near-surface air temperature over Europe and North America against both observation-based data and reanalyses. Several climate models perform well to the extent that these models’ performance is competitive with the performance of another data product in simulating the evaluation set. While the model rankings vary with region, season and index, the model evaluation is robust against changes in the grid resolution considered in the analysis. When the model simulations are ranked based on their similarity with the ERA5 reanalysis, more CMIP6 than CMIP5 models appear at the top of the ranking. When evaluated against the HadEX2 data product, the overall performance of the two model ensembles is similar.",

These methods were evaluated in a region of the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA). Two Landsat 8 images acquired in 2016 and 2017 were used in our experiments. The impact of training set size was also investigated. The Deep Learning-based approaches clearly outperformed the SVM baseline in our approaches, both in terms of F1-score and Overall Accuracy, with a superiority of S-CNN over EF.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: There is an urgent need to include climate change (CC) themes in health professional education (HPE) to prepare the future health workforce. The Lancet Countdown has identified scientific engagement with the issue of climate change (CC), including coverage in academic journals, as an indicator of progress towards addressing the health effects of CC. Examining the discourse on CC in the HPE academic literature is therefore essential to understand how the health professions are engaging with this. This review explored the literature, including editorials and perspectives articles which are usually excluded from reviews, calling for the inclusion of CC in HPE and examined the emerging themes. Materials and methods: OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, Global Health, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases were searched. Eligible articles were those calling for CC in HPE (2000–August 2022). Data were extracted and analyzed by comparing the themes between articles and identifying trends over time. Results were presented in narrative form. Results: 63 articles were eligible. Four themes were identified (1) Leadership (n = 33 articles): need for HPs to lead on CC and advocate for policy change. (2) Scope (n = 43): proposed CC content for HPE programs, from specific diseases to the broader concept of planetary health. (3) Implementation (n = 30): described how to integrate CC by adapting programs or rebuilding curricula around planetary health. (4) Barriers (n = 14): described barriers including crowded curricula, lack of resources and the political climate within the institution and community. Discussion: The growing engagement of HPE with CC and health is evidence of increasing commitment for inclusion of this content in HP curricula. This segment of the scientific literature is a vehicle for engaging health professionals with emerging evidence-informed climate and health issues.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Decadal climate variability in the southern Indian Ocean has great influences on southern African climate through modulation of atmospheric circulation. Although many efforts have been made to understanding physical mechanisms, predictability of the decadal climate variability, in particular, the internally generated variability independent from external atmospheric forcing, remains poorly understood. This study investigates predictability of the decadal climate variability in the southern Indian Ocean using a coupled general circulation model, called SINTEX-F. The ensemble members of the decadal reforecast experiments were initialized with a simple sea surface temperature (SST) nudging scheme. The observed positive and negative peaks during late 1990s and late 2000s are well reproduced in the reforecast experiments initiated from 1994 and 1999, respectively. The experiments initiated from 1994 successfully capture warm SST and high sea level pressure anomalies propagating from the South Atlantic to the southern Indian Ocean. Also, the other experiments initiated from 1999 skillfully predict phase change from a positive to negative peak. These results suggest that the SST-nudging initialization has the essence to capture the predictability of the internally generated decadal climate variability in the southern Indian Ocean.",

    "abstract": "The increase in tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) incidence is observed in recent decades in a number of subarctic countries. The reasons of it are widely discussed in scientific publications. The objective of this study was to understand if the climate change in Arkhangelsk Oblast (AO) situated in the north of European subarctic zone of Russia has real impact on the northward expansion of Ixodid ticks and stipulates the increase in TBE incidence. This study analyzes: TBE incidence in AO and throughout Russia, the results of Ixodid ticks collecting in a number of sites in AO, and TBE virus prevalence in those ticks, the data on tick bite incidence in AO, and meteorological data on AO mean annual air temperatures and precipitations.It is established that in recent years TBE incidence in AO tended to increase contrary to its apparent decrease nationwide. In last 10 years, there was nearly 50-fold rise in TBE incidence in AO when compared with 1980–1989. Probably, the increase both in mean annual air temperatures and temperatures during tick active season resulted in the northward expansion of Ixodes Persulcatus, main TBE virus vector. The Ixodid ticks expansion is confirmed both by the results of ticks flagging from the surface vegetation and by the tick bite incidence in the population of AO locations earlier free from ticks. Our mathematical (correlation and regression) analysis of available data revealed a distinct correlation between TBE incidence and the growth of mean annual air temperatures in AO in 1990–2009.Not ruling out other factors, we conclude that climate change contributed much to the TBE incidence increase in AO.",
