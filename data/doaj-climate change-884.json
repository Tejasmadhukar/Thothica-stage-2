    "abstract": "The relationship between terrestrial water storage (TWS) and atmospheric processes has important implications for predictability of climatic extremes and projection of future climate change. In places where moisture availability limits evapotranspiration (ET), variability in TWS has the potential to influence surface energy fluxes and atmospheric conditions. Where atmospheric conditions, in turn, influence moisture availability, a full feedback loop exists. Here we developed a novel approach for measuring the strength of both components of this feedback loop, i.e., the forcing of the atmosphere by variability in TWS and the response of TWS to atmospheric variability, using satellite observations of TWS, precipitation, solar radiation, and vapor pressure deficit during 2002–2014. Our approach defines metrics to quantify the relationship between TWS anomalies and climate globally on a seasonal to interannual timescale. Metrics derived from the satellite data were used to evaluate the strength of the feedback loop in 38 members of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble (LENS) and in six models that contributed simulations to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We found that both forcing and response limbs of the feedback loop in LENS were stronger than in the satellite observations in tropical and temperate regions. Feedbacks in the selected CMIP5 models were not as strong as those found in LENS, but were still generally stronger than those estimated from the satellite measurements. Consistent with previous studies conducted across different spatial and temporal scales, our analysis suggests that models may overestimate the strength of the feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere. We describe several possible mechanisms that may contribute to this bias, and discuss pathways through which models may overestimate ET or overestimate the sensitivity of ET to TWS.",

    "abstract": "Many plant species are likely to face population decline or even extinction in the coming century, especially those with a limited distribution and inadequate dispersal relative to the projected rates of climate change. The obligate seeding California endemic, Ceanothus perplexans is especially at risk, and depending on how climate change interacts with altered fire regimes in Southern California, certain populations are likely to be more at risk than others. To identify which areas within the species’ range might need conservation intervention, we modeled population dynamics of C. perplexans under various climate and fire regime change scenarios, focusing on spatially explicit patterns in fire frequency. We used a species distribution model to predict the initial range and potential future habitat, while adapting a density-dependent, stage-structured population model to simulate population dynamics. As a fire-adapted obligate seeder, simulated fire events caused C. perplexans seeds to germinate, but also killed all adults in the population. Our simulations showed that the total population would likely decline under any combination of climate change and fire scenario, with the species faring best at an intermediate fire return interval of around 30–50 years. Nevertheless, while the total population declines least with a 30–50 year fire return interval, the effect of individual subpopulations varies depending on spatially explicit patterns in fire simulations. Though climate change is a greater threat to most subpopulations, increased fire frequencies particularly threatened populations in the northwest of the species’ range closest to human development. Subpopulations in the mountainous southern end of the range are likely to face the sharpest declines regardless of fire. Through a combination of species distribution modeling, fire modeling, and spatially explicit demographic simulations, we can better prepare for targeted conservation management of vulnerable species affected by global change.",

    "abstract": "It is critical to develop technologies that simultaneously improve agricultural production, offset impacts of climate change, and ensure food security in a changing climate. Within this context, considerable attention has been given to climate-smart agricultural practices (CSA). This study was conducted to investigate the effects of integrating different CSA practices on crop production, soil fertility, and carbon sequestration after being practiced continuously for up to 10 years. The CSA practices include use of soil and water conservation (SWC) structures combined with biological measures, hedgerow planting, crop residue management, grazing management, crop rotation, and perennial crop-based agroforestry systems. The landscapes with CSA interventions were compared to farmers’ business-as-usual practices (i.e., control). Wheat (Triticum sp.) yield was quantified from 245 households. The results demonstrated that yield was 30–45% higher under CSA practices than the control (p < 0.05). The total carbon stored at a soil depth of 1 m was three- to seven-fold higher under CSA landscapes than the control. CSA interventions slightly increased the soil pH and exhibited 2.2–2.6 and 1.7–2.7 times more total nitrogen and plant-available phosphorus content, respectively, than the control. The time series Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) revealed higher soil moisture content under CSA. The findings illustrated the substantial opportunity of integrating CSA practices to build climate change resilience of resource-poor farmers through improving crop yield, reducing nutrient depletion, and mitigating GHG emissions through soil carbon sequestration.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the performance of 6 global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) for simulating temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and relative humidity over 29 cities in Indonesia. Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research Applications (MERRA-2) was considered as reference data to assess the city-wise performance of surface air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and relative humidity simulated by the CMIP6 GCMs during 1980–2014. Six statistical measures were computed in this process (mean annual, seasonal amplitude, mean annual bias, root mean square error, correlation coefficient, and standard deviation). For 29 cities, the mean annual values of surface air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and relative humidity obtained from the GCMs range between 290 to 302 K, 100 cm to 450 cm, 1 to 6 m/s, and 70 to 94%, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the GCMs and the surface air temperature (precipitation) reanalysis dataset ranges from 0.3 to 0.85 (−0.14 to 0.77). The correlation coefficient for wind speed (relative humidity) varies from 0.2 to 0.6 and is positive in some cases (0.2 to 0.8). Subsequently, the relative error that combines the statistical measurement results was calculated for each city and meteorological variable. Results show that for surface air temperature and precipitation, the performance of TaiESM was outstanding over the 10 or more cities. In contrast, for wind speed and relative humidity, NOR-MM and MPI-HR were the best over 7 and 19 cities, respectively. For all the meteorological variables, the performance of AWI was found to be worst over all the cities. The outcomes of this study are essential for climate-resilience planning and GCM selection while performing downscaling experiments. It will also be useful for producing updated national climate change projections for each city in Indonesia and providing new insights into the climate system.",

This reading reveals that sustainable development, such as it was conceived and diffused by UNO, contains many conceptual paradoxes which are due to a positive vision of the interrelationships between economic growth, social equity and safeguarding of the environment. However, the positive and the integrative characteristics of these relations are not always obvious. The difficult implementation of sustainable development however generates new initiatives of co-operation, like the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). It associates developed and developing countries within the framework of the Kyoto protocol whose first application phase goes from 2008 to 2012. A quantitative assessment of this mechanism at August 10, 2008, shows that 1136 projects are validated. They represent a commercial volume of 220 million tons of equivalent CO2 per annum, avoided or saved in developing countries in various activities such as energy industries and waste processing. Developed countries which take great parts in the CDM by financial and technological investments are United Kingdom (38% of the projects) and Switzerland (23% of the projects). India (31% of the projects) and China (22% of the projects) are developing countries most implied in this new mechanism. The propagation of projects illustrates the importance of economic instruments in the implementation of sustainable development at international level.",

    "abstract": "As a sensitive indicator of climate change, forest phenology (e.g., the start of season (SOS)) has profound impacts on the global carbon cycle. Traditional phenological observations are based on surface observation networks. Generally, the outcomes of this manner are less representative and hard to implement in wide forested regions. Remote sensing based observation of forest SOS has currently been a popular way. Those sensors with coarse spatial resolution have been widely used to estimate forest SOS, but they create serious estimation errors in areas of high heterogeneity. Medium-resolution sensors, such as Landsat, face significant challenges in SOS monitoring due to the long revisit period. In this study, we aimed to develop a new method to estimate forest SOS from 2013 to 2019. First, we collected all available Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, and then redefined the linear regression coefficients for the bandpass adjustment to weaken the surface reflectance (SR) differences in different sensors. Subsequently, we improved and developed the modified continuous change detection and classification (MCCDC) model to generate daily vegetation index curves. Finally, we adopted the logistic regression model to test the potential of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface water index (LSWI) in evaluating the annual SOS. The reduced root mean square error (RMSE) for all bands after the integration indicated that the adjustment was successful. We visually compared Landsat’s synthetic images with the actual acquired images and found that their respective false-colour composites were highly similar. Assessing the SOS from the EVI, NDVI and LSWI showed different estimated results. By comparing the annual SOS derived from the three indices with the field observations, it was found that the SOS based on the EVI maintained a low consistency with the field observations. The SOS accuracy from LSWI was the highest and most forest SOS from LSWI in the study area were mainly concentrated in 80–150 days. These three indices all showed that the SOS always fluctuated by ± 4 days from 2013 to 2019. Facing the lack of clear remote sensing images with medium spatial resolution in cloudy and rainy areas, this study proposes an improved method to generate clear daily vegetation index images at a spatial resolution of 30 m, making annual SOS monitoring promising and feasible.",

A great many small island states and territories are participating in the BRI, particularly in its constituent 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road.

Furthermore, the BRI’s conceptual basis in rhetoric of mutual dependence and a community of common destiny have not always been evident in the individual activities that have been carried out within the BRI. If the BRI’s goals are to be taken seriously, it must do more to focus on the needs and perspectives of island communities, particularly with regard to climate change adaptation.

    "abstract": "Climate change is increasingly driving fundamental shifts in ecosystems, land use, and human livelihoods. Because of these rapid shifts, some conventional adaptation strategies may have limited success in reducing the impact of climate change. In some circumstances, there will be a need for considering transformative changes as part of adaptation strategies that can provide long-term benefits and address the root causes of vulnerability. However, to date, there is limited understanding of how societies respond to, or drive, transformative changes in social-ecological systems due to climate change impact. We reviewed 60 empirical case studies of shifts in trajectories of social-ecological systems in tropical and subtropical countries that were driven by climate change to identify how societies responded to these shifts and the extent to which societies used transformative adaptation as part of this response. In the case studies, we identified three types of shifts driven by climate change depending on whether the shift occurred in the ecological, social, or social-ecological system. Climate change shifted the trajectories of social-ecological systems by altering the feedback loops connecting soil, water, or vegetation conditions with people's livelihoods and well-being. In response to these shifts, people adjusted land use policies and practices, but only one-quarter of the reported adaptation actions included transformative adaptation. A more holistic understanding of how climate change modifies interactions in social-ecological systems and leads to shifts in system trajectories could help identify appropriate adaptation responses, including transformative adaptation, that provide long-term and sustainable benefits.",

We take stock of this budding research area to further show the strength of SEN analysis for complex human-environment settings, identify future synergies between SEN and wider human-environment research, and provide guidance about when to use different kinds of SEN approaches and models. We characterize SEN research along a spectrum specifying the degree of explicit network representation of system components and dynamics. We then systematically review one end of this spectrum, what we term ‘fully articulated SEN’ studies, which specifically model unique social and ecological units and relationships. Results show a larger number of papers focus on methodological advancement and applied ends. While there has been some development and testing of theories, this remains an area for future work and would help develop SENs as a unique field of research, not just a method. Authors have studied diverse systems, while mainly focusing on the problem of social-ecological fit alongside a scattering of other topics. There is strong potential, however, to engage other issues central to human-environment studies. Analyzing the simultaneous effects of multiple social, environmental, and coupled processes, change over time, and linking network structures to outcomes are also areas for future advancement. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of (fully articulated) SEN research, a necessary step that can help scholars develop comparable cases and fill research gaps.",
