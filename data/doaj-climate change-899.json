    "abstract": "Abstract Uncovering the genetic basis of local adaptation is a major goal of evolutionary biology and conservation science alike. In an era of climate change, an understanding of how environmental factors shape adaptive diversity is crucial to predicting species response and directing management. Here, we investigate patterns of genomic variation in giant sequoia, an iconic and ecologically important tree species, using 1,364 bi‐allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We use an FST outlier test and two genotype–environment association methods, latent factor mixed models (LFMMs) and redundancy analysis (RDA), to detect complex signatures of local adaptation. Results indicate 79 genomic regions of potential adaptive importance, with limited overlap between the detection methods. Of the 58 loci detected by LFMM, 51 showed strong correlations to a precipitation‐driven composite variable and seven to a temperature‐related variable. RDA revealed 24 outlier loci with association to climate variables, all of which showed strongest relationship to summer precipitation. Nine candidate loci were indicated by two methods. After correcting for geographic distance, RDA models using climate predictors accounted for 49% of the explained variance and showed significant correlations between SNPs and climatic factors. Here, we present evidence of local adaptation in giant sequoia along gradients of precipitation and provide a first step toward identifying genomic regions of adaptive significance. The results of this study will provide information to guide management strategies that seek to maximize adaptive potential in the face of climate change.",

In this study, we predicted the risk of establishment and number of generations for P. absoluta in the current and future climatic conditions under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) of the years 2050 and 2070 using insect life cycle modelling (ILCYM) software. We used a temperature-dependent phenology model to project three risk indices viz., establishment risk index (ERI), generation index (GI), and activity index (AI) based on temperature data. The model projected large suitable areas for P. absoluta establishment in the Southern hemisphere under current and future climatic scenarios, compared to the Northern part. However, the risk of P. absoluta is expected to increase in Europe, USA, Southern Africa, and some parts of Asia in the future. Under current conditions, P. absoluta can complete between 6 and 16 generations per year in suitable areas. However, an increase in GI between 1 and 3 per year is projected for most parts of the world in the future, with an increase in AI between 1 and 4. Our results provide information on the risk of establishment of P. absoluta which could guide decision-makers to develop control strategies adapted for specific agro-ecological zones.",

    "abstract": "Under changing climatic conditions, drought may become a critical constraint for trees in urban areas, particularly at roadsides and highly paved squares. As healthy urban trees have proven to be an important mitigation and adaptation tool for climate change as well as a significant provider of ecosystem services, there is a need for planting species and cultivars capable of coping with the limited water supply. However, data on species’ and cultivars’ response to drought, particularly their water supplying root systems remains rare. To consider the whole plant responses to drought situations, we studied the growth and phenology of three frequently planted tree species and cultivars with a diameter of 5−6 cm during a one-year rainfall exclusion experiment conducted in a nursery field as well as the dry biomass of the compartments branch, stem, and root after excavation. Our results revealed that species’ and cultivars’ performance were linked to their within-plant carbon partitioning. A high tolerance to drought was noted for Acer campestre, with a particularly high ratio of root:shoot ratio, which made it presumably less susceptible to droughts. Tilia cordata ‘Greenspire’ was highly affected by the reduced water availability visible through prematurely leaf senescence, while Carpinus betulus ‘Fastigiata’ suffered from losing a considerable part of its root biomass, which resulted in the lowest root:shoot ratio of all species and cultivars. This study demonstrated the need for investigating the reaction patterns of species and cultivars by considering both the above-and the below-ground plant parts. We recommend that, for future tree plantings at harsh and challenging urban sites, an important selection criterion should be species’ and cultivars’ capability to develop and retain strong and dense root systems even under limited water supply, as that is believed to be an important trait for drought tolerance.",

In this context, meta-analyses are becoming a popular tool for supporting benefit transfer in environmental valuation. This paper raises the question whether meta-analysis is an option for transferring landscape values using DCEs within Europe. We argue that the use of specific and different attributes, definitions and units of measurement makes it hard to compare willingness-to-pay values across current DCE studies",

    "abstract": "Owing to the anthropogenic pressures, the global food system is undergoing significant changes. Due to increasing human population forecasted, more than 9 billion by 2050, there is an increase in the food demand and consumption by whole population. The world as a whole is undergoing several transformative changes. Growing population, changing lifestyles, expanding urbanization and accelerated climate changes are forming novel challenges for the global livestock system. Day-by-day due to continuous changes in food consumption patterns, i.e. increased demand for cattle products, resulting from urbanisation, rising affluence, and nutritional and environmental concerns are influencing what we eat, who consumes it, and how much we eat more than ever before. The dual burdens of nutrition, i.e. either overconsumption or malnutrition, along with the need to alleviate the climate change effects, are shaping research priorities, influencing policy, and changing peopleâ€™s perceptions of food in different ways. The livestock industry is a fast-paced industry. It is changing in developing nations as a result of the rapidly increasing demand for animal products. Demand for cattle products is stagnant in industrialised countries, while many production techniques are improving their efficiency and environmental sustainability. Human population expansion, wealth growth, and urbanisation have all influenced demand for products of livestock in the past, and the production response in various livestock systems has been linked to science and technology and rises in animal population. Rivalry for natural resources, notably land and water, as well as competition between food and feed, will progressively effect output in the future. Recognition of United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a broad framework that directs growth of the global livestock sector.",

    "abstract": "Extremes in climate have significant impacts on ecosystems and are expected to increase under future climate change. Extremes in vegetation could capture such impacts and indicate the vulnerability of ecosystems, but currently have not received a global long-term assessment. In this study, a robust method has been developed to detect significant extremes (low values) in biweekly time series of global normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 1982 to 2006 and thus to acquire a global pattern of vegetation extreme frequency. This pattern coincides with vegetation vulnerability patterns suggested by earlier studies using different methods over different time spans, indicating a consistent mechanism of regulation. Vegetation extremes were found to aggregate in Amazonia and in the semi-arid and semi-humid regions in low and middle latitudes, while they seldom occurred in high latitudes. Among the environmental variables studied, extreme low precipitation has the highest slope against extreme vegetation. For the eight biomes analyzed, these slopes are highest in temperate broadleaf forest and temperate grassland, suggesting a higher sensitivity in these environments. The results presented here contradict the hypothesis that vegetation in water-limited semi-arid and semi-humid regions might be adapted to drought and suggest that vegetation in these regions (especially temperate broadleaf forest and temperate grassland) is highly prone to vegetation extreme events under more severe precipitation extremes. It is also suggested here that more attention be paid to precipitation-induced vegetation changes than to temperature-induced events.",

    "abstract": "Emission metrics are used to compare the climate effect of the emission of different species, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The most common metrics use linear impulse response functions (IRFs) derived from a single more complex model. There is currently little understanding on how IRFs vary across models, and how the model variation propagates into the metric values. In this study, we first derive CO2 and temperature IRFs for a large number of complex models participating in different intercomparison exercises, synthesizing the results in distributions representing the variety in behaviour. The derived IRF distributions differ considerably, which is partially related to differences among the underlying models, and partially to the specificity of the scenarios used (experimental setup). In a second part of the study, we investigate how differences among the IRFs impact the estimates of global warming potential (GWP), global temperature change potential (GTP) and integrated global temperature change potential (iGTP) for time horizons between 20 and 500 yr. Within each derived CO2 IRF distribution, underlying model differences give similar spreads on the metrics in the range of −20 to +40% (5–95% spread), and these spreads are similar among the three metrics. GTP and iGTP metrics are also impacted by variation in the temperature IRF. For GTP, this impact depends strongly on the lifetime of the species and the time horizon. The GTP of black carbon shows spreads of up to −60 to +80% for time horizons to 100 yr, and even larger spreads for longer time horizons. For CH4 the impact from variation in the temperature IRF is still large, but it becomes smaller for longer-lived species. The impact from variation in the temperature IRF on iGTP is small and falls within a range of ±10% for all species and time horizons considered here. We have used the available data to estimate the IRFs, but we suggest the use of tailored intercomparison projects specific for IRFs in emission metrics. Intercomparison projects are an effective means to derive an IRF and its model spread for use in metrics, but more detailed analysis is required to explore a wider range of uncertainties. Further work can reveal which parameters in each IRF lead to the largest uncertainties, and this information may be used to reduce the uncertainty in metric values.",

    "abstract": "Coastal wetlands are considered as a significant sink of global carbon due to their tremendous organic carbon storage. Coastal CO2 and CH4 flux rates play an important role in regulating atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations. However, the relative contributions of vegetation, soil properties, and spatial structure on dry-season ecosystem carbon (C) rates (net ecosystem CO2 exchange, NEE; ecosystem respiration, ER; gross ecosystem productivity, GEP; and CH4) remain unclear at a regional scale. Here, we compared dry-season ecosystem C rates, plant, and soil properties across three vegetation types from 13 locations at a regional scale in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). The results showed that the Phragmites australis stand had the greatest NEE (-1365.4 μmol m-2 s-1), ER (660.2 μmol m-2 s-1), GEP (-2025.5 μmol m-2 s-1) and acted as a CH4 source (0.27 μmol m-2 s-1), whereas the Suaeda heteroptera and Tamarix chinensis stands uptook CH4 (-0.02 to -0.12 μmol m-2 s-1). Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that plant biomass was the main factor explaining all of the investigated carbon rates (GEP, ER, NEE, and CH4); while soil organic carbon was shown to be the most important for explaining the variability in the processes of carbon release to the atmosphere, i.e., ER and CH4. Variation partitioning results showed that vegetation and soil properties played equally important roles in shaping the pattern of C rates in the YRD. These results provide a better understanding of the link between ecosystem C rates and environmental drivers, and provide a framework to predict regional-scale ecosystem C fluxes under future climate change.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change, global warming, environmental pollution, and fossil fuel depletion have been identified as critical current scenarios and future challenges. Cement plants are one of the most impressive zones, emitting 15% of the worldwide contaminations into the environment among various industries. These contaminants adversely affect human well-being, flora, and fauna. Meanwhile, the use of cement-based substances in various fields, such as civil engineering, medical applications, etc., is inevitable due to the continuous increment of population and urbanization. To cope with this challenge, numerous filtering methods, recycling techniques, and modeling approaches have been introduced. Among the various statistical, mathematical, and computational modeling solutions, Python has received tremendous attention because of the benefit of smart libraries, heterogeneous data integration, and meta-models. The Python-based models are able to optimize the raw material contents and monitor the released pollutants in cement complex outputs with intelligent predictions. Correspondingly, this paper aims to summarize the performed studies to illuminate the resultant emissions from the cement complexes, their treatment methods, and the crucial role of Python modeling toward the high-efficient production of cement via a green and eco-friendly procedure. This comprehensive review sheds light on applying smart modeling techniques rather than experimental analysis for fundamental and applied research and developing future opportunities.",
