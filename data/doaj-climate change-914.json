    "abstract": "Abstract Background Similar to other urban trees, holm oaks (Quercus ilex L.) provide a physiological, ecological and social service in the urban environment, since they remove atmospheric pollution. However, the urban environment has several abiotic factors that negatively influence plant life, which are further exacerbated due to climate change, especially in the Mediterranean area. Among these abiotic factors, increased uptake of Na + and Cl − usually occurs in trees in the urban ecosystem; moreover, an excess of the tropospheric ozone concentration in Mediterranean cities further affects plant growth and survival. Here, we produced and annotated a de novo leaf transcriptome of Q. ilex as well as transcripts over- or under-expressed after a single episode of O3 (80 nl l-1, 5 h), a salt treatment (150 mM for 15 days) or a combination of these treatments, mimicking a situation that plants commonly face, especially in urban environments. Results Salinity dramatically changed the profile of expressed transcripts, while the short O3 pulse had less effect on the transcript profile. However, the short O3 pulse had a very strong effect in inducing over- or under-expression of some genes in plants coping with soil salinity. Many differentially regulated genes were related to stress sensing and signalling, cell wall remodelling, ROS sensing and scavenging, photosynthesis and to sugar and lipid metabolism. Most differentially expressed transcripts revealed here are in accordance with a previous report on Q. ilex at the physiological and biochemical levels, even though the expression profiles were overall more striking than those found at the biochemical and physiological levels. Conclusions We produced for the first time a reference transcriptome for Q. ilex, and performed gene expression analysis for this species when subjected to salt, ozone and a combination of the two. The comparison of gene expression between the combined salt + ozone treatment and salt or ozone alone showed that even though many differentially expressed genes overlap all treatments, combined stress triggered a unique response in terms of gene expression modification. The obtained results represent a useful tool for studies aiming to investigate the effects of environmental stresses in urban-adapted tree species.",

    "abstract": "We explore the effect of individual perceptions of climate anomalies on collective action within a context of environmental complexity and uncertainty. To do so, we construct two competing propositions that are theoretically robust but with very different real-world implications. Our first proposition suggests that collective action to adapt to climate change is likely to be more effective when perceptions of climate anomalies converge within a community. Our second proposition suggests the opposite: that convergence is likely to hinder adaptation behaviour. We use a community co-designed measure of perceptions and an artefactual field experiment to test our propositions and explore the effect of perception convergence on climate change adaptation behaviour in six communities in Malaysian Borneo. We find a robust positive relationship between convergent perceptions of climate anomalies and the collective action required to adapt to climate change. Our findings suggest that perception convergence is an underexplored and potentially crucial factor that can either drive or hinder adaptation efforts at the community-level.",

    "abstract": "Study region: Metal and nutrient concentrations were analysed from freshwater and soil collected from a relatively unmodified ephemeral subtropical catchment in Central Queensland, Australia. Samples were collected quarterly between December 2012 and December 2014. Study focus: There is increasing concern about the health effects of manganese in drinking water, prompting interest in understanding manganese dynamics. This study investigated the temporal and spatial patterns of metals and nutrients, as influenced by summer rainfall; and the impacts of those variables on drinking water, associated infrastructure and concomitant health risks. New hydrological insights for region: Results show that the hydrogeochemistry of Baffle Creek was predominantly driven by rain events, with differing responses to varying magnitudes of rain and discharge. Following a flushing event, dissolved aluminium and nitrate increased in the surface and drinking water, whereas manganese and ammonia were undetectable in the drinking water and occurred only in small concentrations in the surface waters. In contrast, when rainfall events occurred without an associated flush, manganese, iron and ammonia concentrations increased in the drinking water. The hydrochemistry of manganese and iron in the supply chain infrastructure was strongly positively correlated with ammonia, and aluminium correlated with nitrate concentrations. Currently the drinking water supply does not pose a threat to chronic manganese exposure for humans, however elevated concentrations are experienced periodically; and may become more problematic under climate change scenarios.",

    "abstract": "International attention to climate change phenomena has grown in the last decade; the active layer and permafrost are of great importance in understanding processes and future trends due to their role in energy flux regulation. The objective of this paper is to present active-layer temperature data for one Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring South hemisphere (CALM-S) site located on the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, maritime Antarctica over an 57-month period (2008–2012). The monitoring site was installed during the summer of 2008 and consists of thermistors (accuracy of ±0.2 °C), arranged vertically with probes at different depths, recording data at hourly intervals in a high-capacity data logger. A series of statistical analyses was performed to describe the soil temperature time series, including a linear fit in order to identify global trends, and a series of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models was tested in order to define the best fit for the data. The affects of weather on the thermal regime of the active layer have been identified, providing insights into the influence of climate change on permafrost. The active-layer thermal regime in the studied period was typical of periglacial environments, with extreme variation in surface during the summer resulting in frequent freeze and thaw cycles. The active-layer thickness (ALT) over the studied period shows a degree of variability related to different annual weather conditions, reaching a maximum of 117.5 cm in 2009. The ARIMA model could describe the data adequately and is an important tool for more conclusive analysis and predictions when longer data sets are available. Despite the variability when comparing temperature readings and ACT over the studied period, no trend can be identified.",

    "abstract": "The European Union (EU), which has led international discussions on global warming, officially announced its plan for the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in July 2021. Many existing studies have indicated the CBAM will curtail greenhouse gases, and will subsequently be positive in terms of reducing global warming. However, serious legal issues and trade disputes are expected in terms of the compatibility of the CBAM with the trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Contrary to the EU’s explanation, the international community has a strong view of CBAM as a new trade barrier under the guise of preventing global warming. Above all, this is because it is an arbitrary measure by the EU and not the one that has been internationally agreed upon. Therefore, this paper tries to identify the pitfalls and estimate the global cost of CBAM, arguing that the mechanism is not in line with international trade rules, and that many countries will not sit back and suffer from it. The world economy will inevitably face a vicious cycle of trade retaliation. The CBAM will drive up trade costs and cause another trade distortion. While the goal of preventing climate change is good, the CBAM scheme is too costly for the world economy.",

In contrast, we used observation data from a boundary layer radar wind profiler, radio-acoustic sounding system, and automatic meteorological station located at Shenzhen Bao’an International Airport to analyse changes in wind and virtual temperature in the upper level atmosphere, with a top height of 1,200 m, over the Pearl River Estuary between 2011 and 2020. Our results show that during the decade evaluated, the wind speed and virtual temperature of the upper level atmosphere over the Pearl River Estuary changed very significantly and faster than the changes observed at ground level. During the study period, the linear warming rate of the virtual temperature of the upper level atmosphere reached 0.24°C/a, whereas that on the land surface was 0.17°C/a. The mean decreases in the upper level atmosphere and land surface wind speeds were −0.12 and −0.05 m/s·a, respectively. Additionally, the rate of change in the upper level climate was faster in winter than in summer for both wind speed and virtual temperature. These changes in the climate of the upper level atmosphere over the Pearl River Estuary may be related to the rapid increase in the number of high-rise buildings in the region during that decade, which generally negatively affected the atmospheric environment.",

    "abstract": "Energy gives personal comfort to people, and is essential for the generation of commercial and societal wealth. Nevertheless, energy production and consumption place considerable pressures on the environment, such as the emission of green- house gases and air pollutants. They contribute to climate change, damage natural ecosystems and the man-made environment, and cause adverse effects to human health. Lately, novel market schemes emerge, such as the formation and operation of customer coalitions aiming to improve their market power through the pursuit of common benefits. In this paper we present CASSANDRA, an open source 1 , expandable software platform for modelling the demand side of power systems, focusing on small scale consumers. The structural elements of the platform are a) the electrical installations (i.e. households, commercial stores, small industries etc.), b) the respective appliances installed, and c) the electrical consumption-related activities of the people residing in the installations. CASSANDRA serves as a tool for simulation of real demand- side environments providing decision support for energy market stakeholders. The ultimate goal of the CASSANDRA simulation functionality is the identification of good practices that lead to energy efficiency, clustering electric energy consumers according to their consumption patterns, and the studying consumer change behaviour when presented with various demand response programs.",
