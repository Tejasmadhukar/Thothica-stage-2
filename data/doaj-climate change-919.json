    "abstract": "Corporate carbon footprint data has become ubiquitous. This data is also highly promissory. But as this paper argues, such data fails both consumers and citizens. The governance of climate change seemingly requires a strong foundation of data on emission sources. Economists approach climate change as a market failure, where the optimisation of the atmosphere is to be evidence based and data driven. Citizens or consumers, state or private agents of control, all require deep access to information to judge emission realities. Whether we are interested in state-led or in neoliberal ‘solutions’ for either democratic participatory decision-making or for preventing market failure, companies’ emissions need to be known. This paper draws on 20 months of ethnographic fieldwork in a Fortune 50 company’s environmental accounting unit to show how carbon reporting interferes with information symmetry requirements, which further troubles possibilities for contesting data. A material-semiotic analysis of the data practices and infrastructures employed in the context of corporate emissions disclosure details the situated political economies of data labour along the data processing chain. The explicit consideration of how information asymmetries are socially and computationally shaped, how contexts are shifted and how data is systematically straightened out informs a reflexive engagement with Big Data. The paper argues that attempts to automatise environmental accounting’s veracity management by means of computing metadata or to ensure that data quality meets requirements through third-party control are not satisfactory. The crossover of Big Data with corporate environmental governance does not promise to trouble the political economy that hitherto sustained unsustainability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pastoralists in the Borana zone of southern Ethiopia are grappling with climatic risks and impacts, and their livelihoods appear to be precarious. The long-term changes in precipitation, temperature and extreme events are under-researched aspects of climate risk in the study area. Climate observations, local people’s experiences, and memories of weather and drought patterns were analysed in this work to better understand the climate risks in the study region and provide actionable knowledge to facilitate adaptations. In southern Ethiopia, the primary drivers of climate risks are rainfall variabilities, rising temperatures, and drought. The annual rainfall variability observed in the study area (20–35%) is greater than the overall estimate for Eastern Africa (15–25%), indicative of a heightened climate risk in this area. Furthermore, seasonal and intra-seasonal rainfall variabilities are being aggravated by rising temperatures, leading to increased frequency and magnitude of extreme events, particularly in the lowland area. These changes, specifically droughts of different intensities occurring every 2–3 years, erode the livelihood of the pastoralists. The lack of consensus among stakeholders as to the causes and aggravating factors of these climate changes impedes adaptation actions. The authors recommend the importance of initiating a participatory platform that will facilitate discussion on climate change to create a common understanding of the problem and relate it to public policy. The use of gridded precipitation and temperature data is recommended in future research to improve the availability of climate information for climate risk management. In addition, the use of mixed methods and local knowledge, as demonstrated in this study, is highly recommended to better understand climate risks, particularly when there is a limited availability and quality of long-time-series climate data.",

Our goal was to determine the impacts of water level changes in Lake Superior on the periphyton community assemblages in the Keweenaw Peninsula with different surface geology. At three sites, we identified periphyton assemblages as a function of depth, determined surface area of periphyton habitat using high resolution bathymetry, and estimated the impact of water level changes in Lake Superior on periphyton habitat. Our results suggest that substrate geology influences periphyton community assemblages in the Keweenaw Peninsula. Using predicted changes in water levels, we found that a decrease in levels of 0.63 m resulted in a loss of available surface area for periphyton habitat by 600 to 3000 m2 per 100 m of shoreline with slopes ranging 2 to 9°. If water levels rise, the surface area of substrate will increase by 150 to 370 m2 per 100 m of shoreline, as the slopes above the lake levels are steeper (8–20°). Since periphyton communities vary per site, changes in the surface area of the substrate will likely result in a shift in species composition, which could alter the structure of aquatic food webs and ecological processes.",

    "abstract": "High-density living and heatwaves are increasing, at the same time as the population is ageing. The aim of this literature review was to examine the intersection between older and/or vulnerable people, who live in high-density/high-rise situations, and their health during heatwaves. Using electronic databases, the literature was examined. Articles were included if they were: (1) published in English, (2) examined the relationship between building, health, and extreme heat, and (3) included older or vulnerable populations. A total of 241 articles were identified of which 15 were duplicates and 209 did not meet the inclusion criteria. Of the 17 studies included in the review, 4 were conducted following heatwaves in Chicago and Europe. These identified a relationship between age, vulnerability, and floor of residence, in people who died because of the heatwave. High-rise living is increasing globally, and residents are getting older. This, in combination with increased heatwave intensity and frequency, highlights the risk of morbidity and mortality in this group, particularly where there is no access to air-conditioning because of power grid overload in the heat. This research benefits older and vulnerable people who live in high-rise buildings, the health professionals who care for them, architects, urban planners, and policy makers.",

    "abstract": "Despite being a relatively remote and well conserved area, the sub-Antarctic ecoregion faces pressing global threats from climate change, the ozone hole and introduced species. Its freshwater ecosystems are one of the least studied components of this biome, but they are known to confront a host of invasive taxa including trout and beavers. We set out to understand the basic characterization and dynamics of organic matter processing and decomposition in sub-Antarctic streams under natural forest (NF) conditions and in ponds constructed by North American beavers (Castor canadensis) (BP). We found these streams have a naturally stable benthic organic matter regime throughout the year with a peak in leaf input from Nothofagus pumilio in autumn. Beaver ponds significantly increased the retention of organic matter and caused significantly higher decomposition rates, probably associated with increased density and biomass of Hyalella spp. As expected, leaf decay rates for N. pumilio, a deciduous species, were higher (NF: -0.0028 day- ± 0.0001 SE; BP: -0.0118 day-1 ± 0.0009 SE) than N. betuloides (a broad-leaf evergreen) (NF: -0.0018 day-1 ± 0.0005 SE; BP: -0.0040 day-1 ± 0.0003 SE). Overall these results indicate that the naturally low decomposition rates (slower than 89% of a global survey of decay rates) for these cold, oligotrophic streams are being modified by introduced beavers to resemble more temperate latitudes.A pesar de ser una zona relativamente remota y bien conservado, la ecorregión subantártica se enfrenta a presiones por amenazas globales por el cambio climático, el agujero de ozono y las especies introducidas. Los ecosistemas de agua dulce son uno de los componentes menos estudiados de este bioma, pero se sabe que enfrentan una serie de taxones invasivos como la trucha y los castores. El propósito de este estudio es entender la caracterización básica y dinámica de descomposición de la materia orgánica en arroyos subantárticos de bosques naturales (NF) y condiciones de los estanques construidas por diques del castor norteamericano (Castor canadensis) (BP). Todos los arroyos estudiados presentaron un régimen naturalmente estable de materia orgánica bentónica, durante todo el ano, con un mayor ingreso de hojas de Nothofagus pumilio en el otono. La retención de materia orgánica aumentó significativamente en BP y causó una mayor tasa de descomposición, probablemente asociada a una mayor densidad y biomasa de Hyalella spp. Como era de esperar, las tasas de descomposición de hojas de N. pumilio, una especie de hoja caduca, fueron mayores (NF: -0,0028 día-1 ± 0,0001 SE; BP: -0,0118 día-1 ± 0,0009 SE) que las de N. betuloides, un árbol de hoja ancha perenne (NF: -0,0018 día-1 ± 0,0001 SE; BP: -0,004 d-1 ± 0,0003 SE). En general, estos resultados que las bajas tasas de descomposición natural (menores al 89% de los casos reportados), para estas corrientes frías y oligotróficas, están siendo modificadas por los castores introducidos, haciéndolas parecerse a aquellas provenientes de arroyos de latitudes más templadas.",

The main focus was to examine the rainfall variability and its future response during wheat crop period (November-April). Mannâ€“Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator test used to detect monotonic trend direction and magnitude of change over time on annual and seasonal basis. The Pettit-Mannâ€“Whitney test applied to detect the change points over the century. Mean annual precipitation varied from 821 mm (in Haridwar) to 1244 mm (in Pithoragarh) whereas it was 75 mm (in Udham Singh Nagar) to 178 mm (in Pithoragarh) during wheat growing period. During the wheat crop period, annual precipitation decrease was noticed in Udham Singh Nagar (-37.1%) which was maximum. Maximum decrease in minimum and maximum temperature during wheat growing period and annual period was observed for Uttarkashi district which was -39.4%, -28% and -25.1%, -21.1%, respectively. Similarly, Champawat was second after Udham Singh Nagar having highest temperature in both the periods. The most affected year of change was 1978 and 1940 in annual precipitation and maximum, minimum temperature, but during wheat growing period it was observed in 1945 and 1978, respectively. Mann Kendal trend test shows decrease in precipitation for all the stations during wheat growing period and annual period. In case of annual minimum temperature, average change was 0.0040C, though during wheat crop period it was 0.009 0C /year.",

While at first sight the work of Parisi seems not to be related to climate science, this is not the case. Giorgio Parisi developed and contributed to many complexity science methods which are nowadays widely used in climate science. Giorgi Parisi also was involved in the development of the “stochastic resonance” idea to explain paleoclimate variability, while Klaus Hasselmann developed stochastic climate models. Here we review and discuss their work from a complex and stochastic systems perspective in order to highlight those aspects of their work. For instance, fractal and multi-fractal analysis of climate data is now widely used and many weather prediction and climate models contain stochastic parameterizations, topics Parisi and Hasselmann have pioneered. Furthermore, Manabe’s work was key to understanding the effects of anthropogenic climate change by the development of key advances in the parameterization of convection and radiative forcing in climate models. We discuss also how their inventive research has shaped current climate research and is still influencing climate modeling and future research directions.",

    "abstract": "The western Himalayan region is susceptible to minor climate changes because of its fragile ecology, which might threaten the valley’s prestigious ecosystems and socio-economic components. The Himalayas’s local climate and weather are vulnerable to and interlinked with world-scale climatic changes since the region’s hydrology is predominantly dominated by snow and glaciers. The Himalayas, notably the Jammu and Kashmir region in the western Himalayas, has clearly shown distinct and robust evidence of climate change. This study used observed data to examine the climatic variability and trends of change in precipitation and temperature for the Kashmir valley between 1980 and 2020. Gulmarg, Pahalgam, Kokernag, Qazigund, Kupwara, and Srinagar (Shalimar) meteorological stations in the Kashmir valley were studied in detail for long- and short-term as well as localized fluctuations in temperature and precipitation. The annual temperature and precipitation fluctuations were calculated using Sen’s slope approach, and the sloping trend was determined using linear regression. The research showed statistically insignificant growing trends in maximum and minimum temperatures throughout the Kashmir valley. The average annual temperature in the Kashmir valley increased by 1.55 °C during the last 41 years (from 1980 to 2020), with a higher rise in maximum and minimum temperature by 2.00 and 1.10 °C, respectively. However, precipitation showed a non-significant decreasing trend concerning time series analysis over 1980 to 2020 in Kashmir valley. Results of annual average maximum temperature at all the stations revealed that Pahalgam (2.2 °C), Kokernag (1.8 °C), and Kupwara (1.8 °C) displayed a steep upsurge and statistically significant trends; however, annual average minimum temperature followed an increasing trend from 1980 to 2020 at all the stations except Shalimar. However, non-significant declining trends in precipitation were recorded at all the locations in Kashmir valley. This changing pattern of temperature and precipitation could have significant environmental consequences, affecting the western Himalayan region’s food security and ecological sustainability.",

    "abstract": "A new online method to analyse water isotopes of speleothem fluid inclusions using a wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy (WS-CRDS) instrument is presented. This novel technique allows us simultaneously to measure hydrogen and oxygen isotopes for a released aliquot of water. To do so, we designed a new simple line that allows the online water extraction and isotope analysis of speleothem samples. The specificity of the method lies in the fact that fluid inclusions release is made on a standard water background, which mainly improves the δ D robustness. To saturate the line, a peristaltic pump continuously injects standard water into the line that is permanently heated to 140 °C and flushed with dry nitrogen gas. This permits instantaneous and complete vaporisation of the standard water, resulting in an artificial water background with well-known δ D and δ18O values. The speleothem sample is placed in a copper tube, attached to the line, and after system stabilisation it is crushed using a simple hydraulic device to liberate speleothem fluid inclusions water. The released water is carried by the nitrogen/standard water gas stream directly to a Picarro L1102-i for isotope determination. To test the accuracy and reproducibility of the line and to measure standard water during speleothem measurements, a syringe injection unit was added to the line. Peak evaluation is done similarly as in gas chromatography to obtain &delta D; and δ18O isotopic compositions of measured water aliquots. Precision is better than 1.5 ‰ for δ D and 0.4 ‰ for δ18O for water measurements for an extended range (−210 to 0 ‰ for δ D and −27 to 0 ‰ for δ18O) primarily dependent on the amount of water released from speleothem fluid inclusions and secondarily on the isotopic composition of the sample. The results show that WS-CRDS technology is suitable for speleothem fluid inclusion measurements and gives results that are comparable to the isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) technique.",
