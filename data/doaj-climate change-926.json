    "abstract": "The expected impacts of climate change on water supplies give rise to many questions about the emergence of situations of tension between resources and uses, especially for territories already fragile hydrological regime. In France, the area subject to the Mediterranean climate is particularly concerned by the water availability issue during summertime, because it is a hot and sparsely watered area and because it attracts more temporary and permanent people every year. Thus, one can wonder how the risk of water scarcity is structured and how the evolution of its components can lead to a critical situation, in which the system’s state generating the risk can be changed. Such a reflection should then focuses on the advent of a critical situation: dynamic balance, technical aspects, regulatory, policy, etc. In our purposes, we are intending to develop a methodology allowing a chronological and probabilistic modeling of the criticity of low flows through kindenograms (from kindunos, danger). We therefore propose to decline this approach for low flows situations, defined as a delicate balance, at both particular time and place, between the available water resource and the combined environmental and societal demand. The low flows' state, conditioned by natural and human forcings, would then translate an \"hydric deficiency\", to satisfy at least one water use, over short or long periods.",

    "abstract": "As current action remains insufficient to meet the goals of the Paris agreement let alone to stabilize the climate, there is increasing hope that solutions related to demand, services and social aspects of climate change mitigation can close the gap. However, given these topics are not investigated by a single epistemic community, the literature base underpinning the associated research continues to be undefined. Here, we aim to delineate a plausible body of literature capturing a comprehensive spectrum of demand, services and social aspects of climate change mitigation. As method we use a novel double-stacked expert—machine learning research architecture and expert evaluation to develop a typology and map key messages relevant for climate change mitigation within this body of literature. First, relying on the official key words provided to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by governments (across 17 queries), and on specific investigations of domain experts (27 queries), we identify 121 165 non-unique and 99 065 unique academic publications covering issues relevant for demand-side mitigation. Second, we identify a literature typology with four key clusters: policy, housing, mobility, and food/consumption. Third, we systematically extract key content-based insights finding that the housing literature emphasizes social and collective action, whereas the food/consumption literatures highlight behavioral change, but insights also demonstrate the dynamic relationship between behavioral change and social norms. All clusters point to the possibility of improved public health as a result of demand-side solutions. The centrality of the policy cluster suggests that political actions are what bring the different specific approaches together. Fourth, by mapping the underlying epistemic communities we find that researchers are already highly interconnected, glued together by common interests in sustainability and energy demand. We conclude by outlining avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration, synthetic analysis, community building, and by suggesting next steps for evaluating this body of literature.",

    "abstract": "Arctic societies, like Arctic environments, exhibit variability and rapid change. Social and environmental changes are sometimes interconnected, but Arctic societies also are buffeted by socioeconomic forces which can create problems or drive changes that eclipse those with environmental roots. Social indicators research offers a general approach for describing change and understanding causality through the use of numerical indices of population, health, education, and other key dimensions that can be compared across places and times. Here we illustrate such work with new analyses of demographic indicators, particularly involving migration, for contemporary communities of three predominantly Inuit Arctic regions: northern Alaska, Greenland, and Nunavut. Many places exhibit persistent outmigration, affecting population growth. Net migration and growth rates are not significantly different, however, comparing northern Alaska communities that are or are not threatened by climate-linked erosion. Stepping back to compare the three regions highlights their contrasting birth rates (high in northern Alaska and Nunavut) and outmigration (high in Alaska and Greenland)—yielding divergent population trajectories of gradual decline in Greenland, erratic but slow growth in Alaska, and rapid growth in Nunavut. Evidence for one consequential pattern observed in northern Alaska and Greenland, disproportionate outmigration by locally-born women, appears weak or absent in Nunavut.",

    "abstract": "The use of remote sensing for developing land cover maps in the Arctic has grown considerably in the last two decades, especially for monitoring the effects of climate change. The main challenge is to link information extracted from satellite imagery to ground covers due to the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of Arctic ecosystems. There is currently no commonly accepted methodological scheme for high-latitude land cover mapping, but the use of remote sensing in Arctic ecosystem mapping would benefit from a coordinated sharing of lessons learned and best practices. Here, we aimed to produce a highly accurate land cover map of the surroundings of the Canadian Forces Station Alert, a polar desert on the northeastern tip of Ellesmere Island (Nunavut, Canada) by testing different predictors and classifiers. To account for the effect of the bare soil background and water limitations that are omnipresent at these latitudes, we included as predictors soil-adjusted vegetation indices and several hydrological predictors related to waterbodies and snowbanks. We compared the results obtained from an ensemble classifier based on a majority voting algorithm to eight commonly used classifiers. The distance to the nearest snowbank and soil-adjusted indices were the top predictors allowing the discrimination of land cover classes in our study area. The overall accuracy of the classifiers ranged between 75 and 88%, with the ensemble classifier also yielding a high accuracy (85%) and producing less bias than the individual classifiers. Some challenges remained, such as shadows created by boulders and snow covered by soil material. We provide recommendations for further improving classification methodology in the High Arctic, which is important for the monitoring of Arctic ecosystems exposed to ongoing polar amplification.",

    "abstract": "Air temperature and precipitation are two important meteorological factors affecting the earth’s energy exchange and hydrological process. High quality temperature and precipitation forcing datasets are of great significance to agro-meteorology and disaster monitoring. In this study, the accuracy of air temperature and precipitation of the fifth generation of atmospheric reanalysis produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA5) and High-Resolution China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (HRCLDAS) datasets are compared and evaluated from multiple spatial–temporal perspectives based on the ground meteorological station observations over major land areas of China in 2018. Concurrently, the applicability to the monitoring of high temperatures and rainstorms is also distinguished. The results show that (1) although both forcing datasets can capture the broad features of spatial distribution and seasonal variation in air temperature and precipitation, HRCLDAS shows more detailed features, especially in areas with complex underlying surfaces; (2) compared with the ground observations, it can be found that the air temperature and precipitation of HRCLDAS perform better than ERA5. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of mean air temperature are 1.3 °C for HRCLDAS and 2.3 °C for ERA5, and the RMSE of precipitation are 2.4 mm for HRCLDAS and 5.4 mm for ERA5; (3) in the monitoring of important weather processes, the two forcing datasets can well reproduce the high temperature, rainstorm and heavy rainstorm events from June to August in 2018. HRCLDAS is more accurate in the area and magnitude of high temperature and rainstorm due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. The evaluation results can help researchers to understand the superiority and drawbacks of these two forcing datasets and select datasets reasonably in the study of climate change, agro-meteorological modeling, extreme weather research, hydrological processes and sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the role of North Atlantic storms degrading a Late Pleistocene rocky shoreline formed by basaltic rocks overlying hyaloclastite rocks on a small volcanic peninsula connected to Gran Canaria in the central region of the Canary Archipelago. A conglomerate dominated by large, ellipsoidal to angular boulders eroded from an adjacent basalt flow was canvassed at six stations distributed along 800 m of the modern shore at El Confital, on the outskirts of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. A total of 166 individual basalt cobbles and boulders were systematically measured in three dimensions, providing the database for analyses of variations in clast shape and size. The goal of this study was to apply mathematical equations elaborated after Nott (2003) and subsequent refinements in order to estimate individual wave heights necessary to lift basalt blocks from the layered and joint-bound sea cliffs at El Confital. On average, wave heights in the order of 4.2 to 4.5 m are calculated as having impacted the Late Pleistocene rocky coastline at El Confital, although the largest boulders in excess of 2 m in diameter would have required larger waves for extraction. A review of the fossil marine biota associated with the boulder beds confirms a littoral to very shallow water setting correlated in time with Marine Isotope Stage 5e (Eemian Stage) approximately 125,000 years ago. The historical record of major storms in the regions of the Canary and Azorean islands indicates that events of hurricane strength were likely to have struck El Confital in earlier times. Due to its high scientific value, the outcrop area featured in this study is included in the Spanish Inventory of Geosites and must be properly protected and managed to ensure conservation against the impact of climate change foreseen in coming years.",

    "abstract": "The degree to which the maintenance of carbon (C) stocks and tree diversity can be jointly achieved in production landscapes is debated. C stocks in forests are decreased by logging before tree diversity is affected, while C stocks in monoculture tree plantations increase, but diversity does not. Agroforestry can break this hysteresis pattern, relevant for policies in search of synergy. We compared total C stocks and tree diversity among degraded forest, complex cacao/fruit tree agroforests, simple shade-tree cacao agroforestry, monoculture cacao, and annual crops in the Konawe District, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. We evaluated farmer tree preferences and the utility value of the system for 40 farmers (male and female). The highest tree diversity (Shannon–Wiener H index 2.36) and C stocks (282 Mg C ha−1) were found in degraded forest, followed by cacao-based agroforestry systems (H index ranged from 0.58–0.93 with C stocks of 75–89 Mg ha−1). Male farmers selected timber and fruit tree species with economic benefits as shade trees, while female farmers preferred production for household needs (fruit trees and vegetables). Carbon stocks and tree diversity were positively related (R2 = 0.72). Adding data from across Indonesia (n = 102), agroforestry systems had an intermediate position between forest decline and reforestation responses. Maintaining agroforestry in the landscape allows aboveground C stocks up to 50 Mg ha−1 and reduces biodiversity loss. Agroforestry facilitates climate change mitigation and biodiversity goals to be addressed simultaneously in sustainable production landscapes.",

As a result, it will be possible to produce wines with increasing alcohol content in the future. Excessively high alcohol content can significantly reduce the wines’ marketability and viticulture’s profitability. Our study seeks to answer how the expected drought in the Southern and Central regions of Europe will affect the future change in the sugar content of grapes. The degree of dryness was examined using the dryness index in the study. Finally, it was analyzed how the dryness index affects the past and future occurrence of maximum sugar content for six grape varieties. The probability of the occurrence of maximum sugar content for most vine grape varieties will decrease in the near future. However, in the distant future, there is a likelihood that the occurrence of maximum sugar content will increase again. If we can maintain the DI ≥ −10 condition with regulated deficit irrigation, the probability of the occurrence of maximum sugar content may decrease significantly in the near future. Ensuring moderate dryness is the only way to achieve the proper sugar content.",

    "abstract": "Climate change may influence the incidence of infectious diseases including those transmitted by ticks. Rhipicephalus sanguineus complex has a worldwide distribution and transmits Rickettsial infections that could cause high mortality rates if untreated. We assessed the potential effects of climate change on the distribution of R. sanguineus in the Americas in 2050 and 2070 using the general circulation model CanESM5 and two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), SSP2-4.5 (moderate emissions) and SSP2-8.5 (high emissions). A total of 355 occurrence points of R. sanguineus and eight uncorrelated bioclimatic variables were entered into a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to produce 50 replicates per scenario. The area under the curve (AUC) value for the consensus model (>0.90) and the partial ROC value (>1.28) indicated a high predictive capacity. The models showed that the geographic regions currently suitable for R. sanguineus will remain stable in the future, but also predicted increases in habitat suitability in the Western U.S., Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia. Scenario 4.5 showed an increase in habitat suitability for R. sanguineus in tropical and subtropical regions in both 2050 and 2070. Habitat suitability is predicted to remain constant in moist broadleaf forests and deserts but is predicted to decrease in flooded grasslands and savannas. Using the high emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario, habitat suitability in tropical and subtropical coniferous forests and temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands was predicted to be constant in 2050. In 2070, however, habitat suitability was predicted to decrease in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and increase in tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests.
