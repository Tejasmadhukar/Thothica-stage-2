    "abstract": "In response to challenges caused by climate change, apple (Malus ×domestica) breeding programs must quickly develop more resilient cultivars. One strategy is to breed for various bloom times. Members of the genus Malus, including domesticated apple, wild species, and hybrids, exhibit striking variations in the bloom date. Although bloom time is strongly influenced by chilling requirements, other aspects of floral development in Malus and their contributions to bloom time are less known. The purpose of this study was to investigate potential connections between predormancy flower development and final bloom time in Malus species. We performed a phenological analysis of flower development in wild and domesticated apple with extreme differences in bloom time over the course of one developmental season. We tracked histological changes in the floral apex of representatives of three early-blooming Malus genotypes (M. ×domestica ‘Anna’ PI 280400, M. orthocarpa PI 589392, M. sylvestris PI 633824) and three late-blooming genotypes (M. angustifolia PI 589763, M. angustifolia PI 613880, M. ×domestica ‘Koningszuur’ PI 188517). Our study documented their floral meristem progression and organ development and expanded on current staging systems for apple flower development to describe the changes observed. The developmental trajectories of each genotype did not group according to bloom category, and we observed variations in the floral development stage at the time of dormancy onset.",

    "abstract": "Many countries are seeking to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Electrification is a key measure for achieving this goal in all sectors, including the transport sector. Meanwhile, there are several emission reduction options in the road transport sector for achieving net-zero emissions when entire energy systems are considered. It is important to consider entire energy systems not only in the transport sector, but also in the energy supply sectors, including emission offset measures of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) under several conditions of energy supply and transport constraints. This article presents the assessment of scenarios estimated by a global energy systems model—the DNE21+ model—that describes detailed technologies considering differences among regions/countries, followed by the comparative evaluation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), International Energy Agency, and BP scenarios. Hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles could also be cost-effective, even under the net-zero world, thanks to the emission offset of CDR under the scenarios with the costs and potentials of CDR which are consistent with the IPCC scenarios and broadly reviewed future costs of direct air capture (DAC) which is one of the CDR.",

    "abstract": "Malaysiaâ€™s stance on food security is largely translated in terms of achieving self-sufficiency in rice production at about 65-70% of the local consumption. Since Malaysia does not have the comparative advantage in rice production, it implements a wide range of market interventions to achieve the intended level of rice production. The policy instruments include among others: guaranteed minimum price for paddy, price control, price and input subsidies and import monopoly. These interventionist instruments may not be sustainable in the long-term as they incur a high budgetary burden to the government, misallocation of resources and liberalization demand from WTO. The industry faces challenges in terms of land competition for urbanization and industrial uses and declining soil fertility due to heavy use of chemical fertilizer. This paper examines the influence of the fertilizer and the cash subsidies, as well as land conversion and fertility on the level of self-sufficiency in rice. A system dynamics model is applied to analyse the causal and feedback relationships of these variables in the paddy production system framework. The study shows that Malaysia may not be able to sustain the targeted self-sufficiency level without adequate R&D to address the production constraints particularly below-optimum productivity and the threats of climate change. The consumption of rice on the other hand continues to rise due to the increase in population. Keywords: Paddy and rice, Malaysia, system dynamics, policy analysis.",

    "abstract": "Although Kazakhstan is a fossil fuel rich country, there is a strong desire by policymakers to develop a green and sustainable economy and contribute to the global energy transition. To understand the overall situation in green technology development in industrial sector, we conducted the first countrywide study in Kazakhstan. In this paper, we present the results of the large survey on the use of ‘green technologies' by industrial companies in every region of the country. We aggregate the 380 reported cases of the use of green technologies by sectors, like energy production, waste management, and some others. We found that the largest number of cases is accumulated in the waste management sector, the smallest, in green building construction. Our work shows that only 266 out of 877 (~30%) industrial organizations in Kazakhstan utilize some form of green technologies. Based on detailed analysis of 141 organizations, Karagandy, East Kazakhstan, Aktobe, and Atyrau regions reported the largest number applications of green technologies among the 17 administrative-territorial units of Kazakhstan. We also discuss barriers to the diffusion of clean technologies. We believe that this work will be of interest to politicians, environmentalists, and practitioners who are concerned about the impacts of global warming.

    "abstract": "We analyse historical (1850–2014) atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) and methane lifetime data from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)/Aerosols and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) simulations. Tropospheric OH changed little from 1850 up to around 1980, then increased by around 9 % up to 2014, with an associated reduction in methane lifetime. The model-derived OH trends from 1980 to 2005 are broadly consistent with trends estimated by several studies that infer OH from inversions of methyl chloroform and associated measurements; most inversion studies indicate decreases in OH since 2005. However, the model results fall within observational uncertainty ranges. The upward trend in modelled OH since 1980 was mainly driven by changes in anthropogenic near-term climate forcer emissions (increases in anthropogenic nitrogen oxides and decreases in CO). Increases in halocarbon emissions since 1950 have made a small contribution to the increase in OH, whilst increases in aerosol-related emissions have slightly reduced OH. Halocarbon emissions have dramatically reduced the stratospheric methane lifetime by about 15 %–40 %; most previous studies assumed a fixed stratospheric lifetime. Whilst the main driver of atmospheric methane increases since 1850 is emissions of methane itself, increased ozone precursor emissions have significantly modulated (in general reduced) methane trends. Halocarbon and aerosol emissions are found to have relatively small contributions to methane trends. These experiments do not isolate the effects of climate change on OH and methane evolution; however, we calculate residual terms that are due to the combined effects of climate change and non-linear interactions between drivers. These residual terms indicate that non-linear interactions are important and differ between the two methodologies we use for quantifying OH and methane drivers. All these factors need to be considered in order to fully explain OH and methane trends since 1850; these factors will also be important for future trends.",

    "abstract": "Soil microbes play vital roles in mediating the functions and services of terrestrial ecosystems in the context of ongoing climate change and human disturbance. There are complex interactions between soil microbial taxa. However, research on the drivers of soil microbial network complexity and stability based on microbial taxa interactions is still in its infancy. We examined network structure and the complexity and stability of soil microbial communities across a large-scale environmental gradient in semi-arid grasslands of northern China by combining network theory and high-throughput sequencing. We found that aridity was the strongest driver of soil microbial network structure. Increasing aridity directly reduced the complexity and stability of soil microbial networks by decreasing the ratio of microbial taxa that participated in network construction and the ratio of potential positive and negative interactions of networks. Soil heterogeneity enhanced microbial network complexity and stability by potentially promoting diverse host plants and mediating uneven distribution of soil resources. These findings suggest that aridity and decreasing soil heterogeneity may have detrimental influences on soil microbial functions and the associated plant performance. This study provides new insights into the controls of climatic and/or edaphic variables in regulating soil microbial networks and highlights the importance of environmental heterogeneity in community assembly mechanisms of soil microbes.",

    "abstract": "The circumpolar north is uniquely vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. While international Arctic collaboration on health has enhanced partnerships and advanced the health of inhabitants, significant challenges lie ahead. One Health is an approach that considers the connections between the environment, plant, animal and human health. Understanding this is increasingly critical in assessing the impact of global climate change on the health of Arctic inhabitants. The effects of climate change are complex and difficult to predict with certainty. Health risks include changes in the distribution of infectious disease, expansion of zoonotic diseases and vectors, changing migration patterns, impacts on food security and changes in water availability and quality, among others. A regional network of diverse stakeholder and transdisciplinary specialists from circumpolar nations and Indigenous groups can advance the understanding of complex climate-driven health risks and provide community-based strategies for early identification, prevention and adaption of health risks in human, animals and environment. We propose a regional One Health approach for assessing interactions at the Arctic human–animal–environment interface to enhance the understanding of, and response to, the complexities of climate change on the health of the Arctic inhabitants.",

    "abstract": "The project ADAPTACLIMA, promoted by EPAL, the largest Portuguese Water Supply Utility, aims to provide the company with an adaptation strategy in the medium and long term to reduce the vulnerability of its activities to climate change. We used the four scenarios (A1, A2, B1, B2) adopted in the Special Report Emissions Scenarios (SRES) of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) to produce local scenarios of water use. Available population SRES for Portugal were downscaled to the study area using a linear approach. Local land use scenarios were produced using the following steps: (1) characterization of the present land use for each municipality of the study area using Corine Land Cover and adaptation of the CLC classes to those used in the SRES; (2) identification of recent tendencies in land use change for the study area; (3) identification of SRES tendencies for land use change in Europe; and (4) production of local scenarios of land use. Water use scenarios were derived considering both population and land use scenarios as well as scenarios of change in other parameters (technological developments, increases in efficiency, climate changes, or political and behavioural changes). The A2 scenario forecasts an increase in population (+16%) in the study area while the other scenarios show a reduction in the resident population (−6 to 8%). All scenarios, but especially A1, show a reduction in agricultural area and an increase in urban area. Regardless of the scenario, water use will progressively be reduced until 2100. These reductions are mainly due to increased water use efficiency and the reduction of irrigated land. The results accord with several projects modelling water use at regional and global level.",

    "abstract": "Closing the carbon cycle by the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formic acid and other high-value chemicals is a promising strategy to mitigate rapid climate change. The main barriers to commercializing a CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) system for formate production are the chemical inertness, low aqueous solubility, and slow mass transport characteristics of CO2, along with the low selectivity and high overpotential observed in formate production via CO2 reduction. To address those problems, we first explain the possible reaction mechanisms of CO2RRs to formate, and then we present and discuss several strategies to overcome the barriers to commercialization. The electronic structure of the catalyst can be tuned to favor a specific intermediate by adjusting the catalyst composition and tailoring the facets, edges, and corners of the catalyst to better expose the active sites, which has primarily led to increased catalytic activity and selectivity. Controlling the local pH, employing a high-pressure reactor, and using systems with three-phase boundaries can tune the mass transport properties of reactants at the catalyst surface. The reported electrocatalytic performances are summarized afterward to provide insight into which strategies have critical effects on the production of formate.",

    "abstract": "Knowing the behavior of extreme hydrological phenomena is essential so that the impacts resulting from these natural events are minimized. Rio Grande do Sul has frequently been hit by extreme events such as droughts and floods, and these events are associated with several consequences, such as energy or water rationing, urban flooding and damage to hydraulic structures. In this context, the analysis of historical series extremes of hydrometeorological data through the Extreme Values Theory ​​(EVT) is one of the ways to determine the variability due to climate change, enabling the modeling of extreme events. EVT makes it possible to know the frequency with which extreme events occur, allowing extrapolation beyond the historical series, generating occurrence probabilities of such an event. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to apply the Extreme Values Theory ​​in hydrological the data historical series of flow and precipitation in the Guaíba hydrographic region and to carry out occurrence probabilities of intense events return, helping in the planning of the hydrographic watersheds that are in this region, as well as to verify whether the EVT has return periods similar to the climate projections of CMIP5 models. The results demonstrate that the values of flow and precipitation, in the historical series used, have already presented changes regarding the volume and frequency of extreme events occurrence and, in the future, for some stations, values ​​can be expected both above and below the extremes already observed in the historical series.",
