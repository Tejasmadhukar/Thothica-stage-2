    "abstract": "The overall agricultural system in the Nile Delta region is considered as one of the highest intensive and complicated agriculture systems in the world. According to the recent studies, the Nile Delta region is one of the highly vulnerable regions in the world to climate change. Sea level rise, soil and water degradation, undiversified crop-pattern, yield reduction, pests and disease severity, and irrigation and drainage management were the main key factors that increased vulnerability of the agriculture sector in that region. The main objective of this study is to conduct a community-based multi-criteria adaptation assessment in the Nile Delta using a preset questionnaire. A list of possible adaptation measures for agriculture sector was evaluated. The results indicated that the Nile Delta growers have strong perceptions to act positively to reduce the impacts of climate change. They reflected the need to improve the their adaptive capacity based on clear scientific message with adequate governmental support to coop with the negative impacts of climate change.",

    "abstract": "The over-dependence on fossil fuels is one of the critical issues to be addressed for combating greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen, one of the promising alternatives to fossil fuels, is renewable, carbon-free, and non-polluting gas. The complete utilisation of hydrogen in every sector ranging from small to large scale could hugely benefit in mitigating climate change. One of the key aspects of the hydrogen sector is its production via cost-effective and safe ways. Electrolysis and photocatalysis are well-known processes for hydrogen production and their efficiency relies on electrocatalysts which are generally noble metals. The usage of noble metals as catalysts makes these processes costly and their scarcity is also a limiting factor. Metal nitrides and their porous counterparts have drawn considerable attention from researchers due to their good promise for hydrogen production. Their properties such as active metal centres, nitrogen functionalities, and porous features such as surface area, pore-volume, and tunable pore size could play an important role in electrochemical and photocatalytic hydrogen production. This review focuses on the recent developments in metal nitrides from their synthesis methods point of view. Much attention is given to the emergence of new synthesis techniques, methods, and processes of synthesizing the metal nitride nanostructures. The applications of electrochemical and photocatalytic hydrogen production are summarised. Overall, this review will provide useful information to researchers working in the field of metal nitrides and their application for hydrogen production.",

    "abstract": "Renewable energy development is a key pathway for mitigating climate change. The Taiwan government has been actively developing low carbon green energy with solar photovoltaic technology and wind power as their primary development projects. Cigu Taiwan provides an ideal research site to examine tradeoffs between ecological conservation, marine fisheries, and green power development, and the factors affect commitments to ecological conservation in the face of these tradeoffs. This research investigates the fishery and electricity symbiosis project in Cigu through a novel combination of the theory of planned behavior and the contingent valuation method to analyze the factors influencing the local residents’ behavioral intentions to safeguard ecological achievements in ecologically fragile areas through conservation trust funds. Analysis of survey responses from a convenience sample of 715 residents and resource users in the Cigu area reports that attitudes (ATT), subjective norms (SN), perceived behavioral control (PBC), environmental concern (EC), and environmental risk (ER) significantly influence the behavioral intention to pay eco-compensation fees; the local residents’ willingness to pay for the conservation trust funds was NTD 621.4/year (USD 21.9/year), and decreased to NTD 545.9/year (USD 19.2/year) after the implementation of fishery and electricity symbiosis. The discussion section argues that the drivers of ATT, SN, PBC, EC, and ER can be used by policy makers to direct local residents’ intentions and behavior toward conserving ecological achievements in fragile eco-environmental areas through payments for ecosystem services. Thus, this strategy can improve the sustainability of ecological and environmental restoration programs.",

    "abstract": "The City Blueprint Approach (CBA) is applied to assess the urban water cycle and sustainability in Antwerp, Belgium. Using two complementary frameworks. The Trends and Pressures Framework (TPF) assesses the city's main social, environmental, financial and governmental challenges based on 18 indicators. The City Blueprint (performance) Framework (CBF) deals with the adequacy of the city's water management, based on 24 mostly-quantitative indicators. The Blue City Index is the geometric mean of the performance-based indicators in the CBF. Our analysis of the TPF identified five major indicators reflecting concern for the urban water cycle of Antwerp: Water Scarcity, Flood Risk, Water Quality, Air Quality (all environmental concerns) and the Unemployment Rate. Antwerp experiences periodic flooding accentuated by sea level rise. Water abstraction rates compared to available water resources reflects water scarcity of ∼33%. The fraction of surface water bodies not achieving ‘good’ ecological status exceeds 90% due to hydromorphological modifications, diminished ecological functioning, and chemical contaminants. Mean air quality in the city exceeds air quality standards several days per year. The CBF framework identifies 4 indicators reflecting ‘poor’ performance for the urban water cycle of Antwerp: GW quality, stormwater separation (CSOs), age of the sewer system and quantity of green space. Less than 25% of the groundwater bodies are of good chemical and/or quantitative status in the Scheldt river basin. The city currently has only limited stormwater separation sewers; separating CSOs is costly. The average age of the sewer system in Flanders is between 25 and 49 years, 66 years old in Antwerp. Sewers are replaced after ∼75 years of service, making water infrastructure a main area of concern. Antwerp's green space (∼17%) is being expanded promoting cooling in warm periods, improves social cohesion and well-being of citizens, and reduces the risk of urban flooding. Having a Blue City Index of 6.2/10, Antwerp ranks amongst the top 20 cities performances (>70 cities). The CBA identifies pressures acting upon the city and its performance on water sustainability in Antwerp. Analyzing the CBF creates opportunities in enhancing water sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge for water resource management in Western Cape, South Africa, is the reduction of the growing sediment and nutrient loads in coastal areas, which belong to the areas most affected by land use change. We used the WebGIS based software STOFFBILANZ to simulate runoff, soil loss, sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen input in the surface water and groundwater of study area (ca. 6,450 km²). The simulated runoff shows a large regional variability caused by the heterogeneous distribution of rainfall. For the reference catchment Klein River simulated total daily runoff fit the observed values of the reference year 2012. The calculation of potential input of sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen into waters is based on aggregated or generalized information on climate data, land use types, crop and fruit types, yields, mineral fertilizers, farm manure, nitrogen fixing by leguminous plants, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, and soil denitrification. Critical source areas for potential sediment input, particulate P input and diffuse N input are mainly agricultural areas. Additionally, point sources of high relevance for N and P are found in urban areas. Based on the potential input of sediment and nutrients the impacts of current land use change on water resources were estimated. We used the web-based information system WebLand for the simulation aiming at the provision of stakeholders with information for decision making in water resource management.",

    "abstract": "Climate change already affects all inhabited regions of the world, with human influence contributing to many observed changes in climate extremes and to mitigate this trend, important decisions have been taken by different world organizations and countries to achieve global net-zero emissions. At the European Union level (EU27 countries), two of the main pillars for achieving carbon neutrality are: (1) The “Energy Efficiency First principle” in the formulation of energy policy and in taking relevant investment decisions and (2) the electrification of the energy sector, supported by generating electricity through endogenous renewable energy sources. In this context, a comprehensive review was carried out on what has been developed by the scientific community and main international energy organizations on the electrification of the energy sector. Additionally, with the purpose of better understanding the state of the art of a country regarding the decarbonization process, the Portuguese energy vectors were identified in terms of which ones can and should be electrified by 2050, based on the data available from Eurostat (2019). Portugal is a country highly dependent on imported energy (78%), where the largest energy vector is from oil and petroleum products (68%) mostly used in the transport sector, where the electrification of the sector will be increased gradually until 2050. However, other decarbonized solutions, such as biofuels and synthetic (green) fuels cannot be ruled out and should be the subject of future work and considered for the decarbonization goals to be achieved in 2050. The main conclusions reflect that there is still a long way to go, much like the rest of the world, as it is necessary to electrify the equivalent to almost all the energy presently imported by Portugal, a tough challenge considering the need for its generation to be decarbonized. In this context, energy efficiency must play an equivalently important role to significantly reduce current energy demand, leading to more cost-effective and resilient energy services.",

    "abstract": "Volcanic fallout in polar ice sheets provides important opportunities to date and correlate ice-core records as well as to investigate the environmental impacts of eruptions. Only the geochemical characterization of volcanic ash (tephra) embedded in the ice strata can confirm the source of the eruption, however, and is a requisite if historical eruption ages are to be used as valid chronological checks on annual ice layer counting. Here we report the investigation of ash particles in a Greenland ice core that are associated with a volcanic sulfuric acid layer previously attributed to the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius. Major and trace element composition of the particles indicates that the tephra does not derive from Vesuvius but most likely originates from an unidentified eruption in the Aleutian arc. Using ash dispersal modeling, we find that only an eruption large enough to include stratospheric injection is likely to account for the sizable (24–85 µm) ash particles observed in the Greenland ice at this time. Despite its likely explosivity, this event does not appear to have triggered significant climate perturbations, unlike some other large extratropical eruptions. In light of a recent re-evaluation of the Greenland ice-core chronologies, our findings further challenge the previous assignation of this volcanic event to 79 CE. We highlight the need for the revised Common Era ice-core chronology to be formally accepted by the wider ice-core and climate modeling communities in order to ensure robust age linkages to precisely dated historical and paleoclimate proxy records.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is a major concern in agriculture; in grapevine production, climate change can affect yield and wine quality as they depend on the complex interactions between weather, plant material, and viticultural techniques. Wine characteristics are strongly influenced by microclimate of the canopy affecting primary and secondary metabolites of the grapevine. Air temperature and water availability can influence sugar and acid concentration in grapes and relative wines, and their content of volatile compounds such as norisoprenoids. This becomes relevant in sparkling wine production where grapes are generally harvested at a relatively low pH, high acidity, and low sugar content and where the norisoprenoids significantly contributes to the final aroma of the wine. The effect of climate change on grapevine and wine, therefore, calls for the implementation of on-field adaptation strategies. Among them canopy management through leaf removal and shading have been largely investigated in the wine growing sector. The present study, conducted over 4 years (2010-2013) aims at investigating how leaf removal and artificial shading strategies affect grape maturation, must quality and the production of norisoprenoids, analyzed using an untargeted approach, in sparkling wine. Specifically, this paper investigates the effect of meteorological conditions (i.e., water availability and temperatures) and the effect of leaf removal and shading on Vitis vinifera L. cv. Chardonnay and Pinot noir, which are suitable to produce sparkling wine in the DOCG Franciacorta wine growing area (Lombardy, Italy). The effect of leaf removal and shading practices on norisoprenoids has been the focus of the study. No defoliation and artificial shading treatments play an important role in the preservation of the acidity in warm seasons and this suggests calibrating defoliation activities in relation to the meteorological trend without standardized procedures. This is particularly relevant in the case of sparkling wine, where the acidity is essential to determine wine quality. The enhanced norisoprenoid aromas obtained with a total defoliation represent a further element to direct defoliation and shading strategies. The obtained results increase knowledge about the effect of different defoliation and artificial shading applications in relation to meteorological condition supporting the management decision-making in the Franciacorta wine growing area.",
