    "abstract": "The effects of drought, a devastating natural disaster, have expanded due to intense global warming. Therefore, studying the spatio-temporal evolution and formation mechanism of drought is urgent and important. In this paper, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) of the source region of Yellow River was calculated for the years 1961–2015, and the heuristic segmentation and Modified Mann-Kendall methods were used to study the change points and trends of precipitation, temperature, and SPEI. The empirical orthogonal function was used to study the major modes of the SPEI, and cross wavelet analysis was used to demonstrate the relationship between SPEI and large-scale climate factors. The results initially demonstrated no change point and an insignificant positive trend in precipitation. Temperature revealed a significant increasing trend, and a change point was detected in 1997. SPEI indicated a change point in 1993, and a significant increasing trend was observed thereafter. These findings reveal that drought in the study area is highly related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. The North Atlantic and Arctic oscillations caused similar impacts on drought. By comparison, changes in SPEI were slightly related to the Pacific decadal oscillation. These results provide useful information for evaluating drought changes in the study area, early warning of drought, and water resource management.",

    "abstract": "The cities of Ljubljana, Trieste and Zagreb are proximate in terms of distance but differ in terms of geographical and climatic conditions. Continuous meteorological measurements in these cities began in the mid-19th century. The 100-year trends of changes in mean annual and seasonal air temperatures for these cities are presented here, evaluating the differences between them which result from their different geographical and climatic positions. Differences in trends between Ljubljana and Zagreb that result from different measurement histories and the impact of urban climate are also presented: the impact of city growth on air temperatures in Ljubljana after 1950 was not completely eliminated in the process of data homogenization. The lowest air warming trends occur in the maritime climate of Trieste (mean annual air temperature: + 0.8 °C × 100 yr−1), where measurements were continuously performed in the densely built-up section of the city. The strongest trends occur in Ljubljana, mainly due to city growth (mean annual air temperature: + 1.1 °C × 100 yr−1). Comparing the linear trends in Zagreb-Grič and in Ljubljana, the impact of Ljubljana's urban heat island on the 100-year warming trend was assessed at about 0.2 °C, at 0.3–0.4 °C for the trend after 1950, and if non-homogenized data are used, at about 0.5 °C.",

Indeed, the general issue is how we should define ethics of the environment and sustainability as a general principle for the Arctic region. It is important to discuss what is at stake and how we define the problem in relation to the different participating stakeholders.

This paper provides a quantitative understanding of the main processes that contribute to the land-sea warming asymmetry in a global warming simulation of the NCAR CCSM4. The CO _2 forcing alone warms the surface nearly the same for both land and sea, suggesting that feedbacks are responsible for the warming contrast. Our analysis on one hand confirms that the principal contributor to the above-unity land-to-sea warming ratio is the evaporation feedback; on the other hand the results indicate that the sensible heat flux feedback has the largest land-sea warming difference that favors a greater ocean than land warming. Therefore, the results uniquely highlight the importance of other feedbacks in establishing the above-unity land-to-sea warming ratio. Particularly, the SW cloud feedback and the ocean heat storage in the transient response are key contributors to the greater warming over land than sea.",

    "abstract": "Almost all developing countries satisfy their energy requirements from firewood. In Ethiopia majority of the rural population relies on biomass energy sources for every energy necessities. Fuelwood accounts for about 78 % of the total energy needs, whereas animal dung and crop residue share 12 % and nine percent, respectively. Almost all of the firewoods are collected from natural forests and few of them from homestead trees. Chronic drought, land degradation, and loss of soil fertility that are positively correlated with low livestock and crop productivity are extensions of deforestation for firewood. Heavy dependency on biomass fuel in Ethiopia has resulted in fast deforestation, desertification, climate change, global warming and finally decrease in agricultural productivity. Therefore the adoption of biogas technologies has great potentials to supply low-cost energy and results in less dependency on firewood. To improve such adverse socio-economic and ecological costs, interventions like improved biogas technologies, raising community awareness on deforestation, and utilization of alternative energy technologies are recommended to conserve natural forests.",

    "abstract": "Aerosol-cloud interactions are considered to be one of the most important and least known forcings in the climate system. Biomass burning aerosols are of special interest due to their radiative impact (direct and indirect effect) and their potential to increase in the future due to climate change. Combining data from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with passive tracers from the FLEXPART Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model, the impact of biomass burning aerosols on marine stratocumulus clouds has been examined in June and July of 2006–2008 off the California coast. Using a continental tracer, the indirect effect of biomass burning aerosols has been isolated by comparing the average cloud fraction and cloud albedo for different meteorological situations, and for clean versus polluted (in terms of biomass burning) continental air masses at 14:00 local time. Within a 500 km-wide band along the coast of California, biomass burning aerosols, which tend to reside above the marine boundary layer, increased the cloud fraction by 0.143, and the cloud albedo by 0.038. Absorbing aerosols located above the marine boundary layer lead to an increase of the lower tropospheric stability and a reduction in the vertical entrainment of dry air from above, leading to increased cloud formation. The combined effect was an indirect radiative forcing of &minus;7.5% &plusmn;1.7% (cooling effect) of the outgoing radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere on average, with a bias due to meteorology of +0.9%. Further away from the coast, the biomass burning aerosols, which were located within the boundary layer, reduced the cloud fraction by 0.023 and the cloud albedo by 0.006, resulting in an indirect radiative forcing of +1.3% &plusmn;0.3% (warming effect) with a bias of +0.5%. These results underscore the dual role that absorbing aerosols play in cloud radiative forcing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Computational advances have made atmospheric modeling at convection‐permitting (≤4 km) grid spacings increasingly feasible. These simulations hold great promise in the projection of climate change impacts including rainfall and flood extremes. The relatively short model runs that are currently feasible, however, inhibit the assessment of the upper tail of rainfall and flood quantiles using conventional statistical methods. Stochastic storm transposition (SST) and process‐based flood frequency analysis are two approaches that together can help to mitigate this limitation. SST generates large numbers of extreme rainfall scenarios by temporal resampling and geospatial transposition of rainfall fields from relatively short data sets. Coupling SST with process‐based flood frequency analysis enables exploration of flood behavior at a range of spatial and temporal scales. We apply these approaches with outputs of 13‐year simulations of regional climate to examine changes in extreme rainfall and flood quantiles up to the 500‐year recurrence interval in a medium‐sized watershed in the Midwestern United States. Intensification of extreme precipitation across a range of spatial and temporal scales is identified in future climate; changes in flood magnitudes depend on watershed area, with small watersheds exhibiting the greatest increases due to their limited capacity to attenuate flood peaks. Flood seasonality and snowmelt are predicted to be earlier in the year under projected warming, while the most extreme floods continue to occur in early summer. Findings highlight both the potential and limitations of convection‐resolving climate models to help understand possible changes in rainfall and flood frequency across watershed scales.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing use of satellite sensors to detect and track oil spills. The satellite bands, namely visible, short, medium infrared, and microwave radar bands, are used for this purpose. The use of satellite images is extremely valuable for oil spill analysis. With satellite images, we can identify the source of leakage and assess the extent of potential damage. However, it is not yet clear how to approach a specific leakage case methodologically. The aim of this study is the remote sensing analysis of environmental changes with the development of oil spill detection processing methods. Innovative elements of the work, in addition to methodological proposals, include the long-term analysis of surface water changes. This is very important because oil is very likely to enter the soil when water levels change. The classification result was satisfactory and accurate by 85%. The study was carried out using images from Landsat 5, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 satellites. The results of the classification of the oil stains in active and passive technologies differ. This difference affects the methodology for selecting processing methods in similar fields. In the case of this article, the oil spill that occurred on 29 May 2020 in Norilsk was investigated and compared with data from other years to determine the extent of biodegradation. Due to the tank failure that occurred at the Nornickel power plant on that day, a large amount of crude oil leaked into the environment, contaminating the waters and soil of local areas. Research shows that oil spills may be caused by human error or may be the effect of climate change, particularly global warming.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the instability of extreme temperatures is defined as the degree of perturbation of the spatial and temporal distribution of extreme temperatures, which is to show the uncertainty of the intensity and occurrence of extreme temperatures in China. Based on identifying the extreme temperatures and by analyzing their variability, we refer to the entropy value in the entropy weight method to study the instability of extreme temperatures. The results show that TXx (annual maximum value of daily maximum temperature) and TNn (annual minimum value of daily minimum temperature) in China increased at 0.18 °C/10 year and 0.52 °C/10 year, respectively, from 1966 to 2015. The interannual data of TXx’ occurrence (CTXx) and TNn’ occurrence (CTNn), which are used to identify the timing of extreme temperatures, advance at 0.538 d/10 year and 1.02 d/10 year, respectively. In summary, extreme low-temperature changes are more sensitive to global warming. The results of extreme temperature instability show that the relative instability region of TXx is located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin, and the relative instability region of TNn is concentrated in the Yangtze River, Yellow River, Langtang River source area and parts of Tibet. The relative instability region of CTXx instability is distributed between 105° E and 120° E south of the 30° N latitude line, while the distribution of CTNn instability region is more scattered; the TXx’s instability intensity is higher than TNn’s, and CTXx’s instability intensity is higher than CTNn’s. We further investigate the factors affecting extreme climate instability. We also find that the increase in mean temperature and the change in the intensity of the El Niño phenomenon has significant effects on extreme temperature instability.",
