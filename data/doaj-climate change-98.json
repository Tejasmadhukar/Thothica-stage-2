    "abstract": "There are several ways of promoting womenâ€™s economic participation while also counteracting climate change. One approach in the field of climate mitigation is theÂ promotion of renewable energies that help avoid greenhouse gas emissions. TheÂ potential of rural women as agents of change for climate mitigation and adaptationÂ remains untapped: Their extensive theoretical and practical knowledge of theÂ environment and resource conservation is not given due consideration. In terms ofÂ economic participation, they are not paid for the environmental services that theyÂ already provide (example, reforestation). The potential contribution of rural women toÂ climate mitigation by being part of the economic cycle is not sufficiently exploited.Â The economic empowerment of women through climate mitigation and adaptationÂ fosters economic growth and socioeconomic development, reduces poverty, keepsÂ environmental problems in check, and increases the potential for adaptation, whichÂ is to the benefit of both women and men. Enhancing the economic empowerment ofÂ women is a catalyst for development, which helps boost a countryâ€™s economicÂ growth, promotes the socioeconomic development not only of women, but of theÂ entire population, and helps reduce poverty. It is observed that less attention is paidÂ to the potential that lies in the combination of climate mitigation/ adaptation and the economic empowerment of rural women. Yet mitigation or adaptation activities offerÂ opportunities to advance the economic empowerment of women. In particular, thisÂ applies to work that is already being undertaken by women or activities in whichÂ women could assume a leading role. In developing countries, for instance, womenÂ frequently play a major role in the reforestation and afforestation of cleared land andÂ in forest conservation, yet they have hardly ever benefited from these environmentalÂ services. The paper addresses the economic empowerment of rural women throughÂ climate change mitigation and adaptation. The study recommends that measures toÂ promote the economic participation of women can be integrated into climateÂ mitigation and adaptation initiatives. In order for rural women to play an economicÂ role, an institutional, legal and political framework is required that enables and/orÂ makes it easier for rural women to hold their own in the market. Concrete, promisingÂ project measures at the local level should therefore be combined with advisory services at the political level related to climate change and the economic empowerment of women, with a view to initiating structural reformÂ",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Ocean warming is a leading cause of increasing episodes of coral bleaching, the dissociation between coral hosts and their dinoflagellate algal symbionts in the family Symbiodiniaceae. While the diversity and flexibility of Symbiodiniaceae is presumably responsible for variations in coral response to physical stressors such as elevated temperature, there is little data directly comparing physiological performance that accounts for symbiont identity associated with the same coral host species. Here, using Pocillopora damicornis harboring genotypically distinct Symbiodiniaceae strains, we examined the physiological responses of the coral holobiont and the dynamics of symbiont community change under thermal stress in a laboratory-controlled experiment. Results We found that P. damicornis dominated with symbionts of metahaplotype D1-D4-D6 in the genus Durusdinium (i.e., PdD holobiont) was more robust to thermal stress than its counterpart with symbionts of metahaplotype C42-C1-C1b-C1c in the genus Cladocopium (i.e., PdC holobiont). Under ambient temperature, however, the thermally sensitive Cladocopium spp. exhibited higher photosynthetic efficiency and translocated more fixed carbon to the host, likely facilitating faster coral growth and calcification. Moreover, we observed a thermally induced increase in Durusdinium proportion in the PdC holobiont; however, this “symbiont shuffling” in the background was overwhelmed by the overall Cladocopium dominance, which coincided with faster coral bleaching and reduced calcification. Conclusions These findings support that lineage-specific symbiont dominance is a driver of distinct coral responses to thermal stress. In addition, we found that “symbiont shuffling” may begin with stress-forced, subtle changes in the rare biosphere to eventually trade off growth for increased resilience. Furthermore, the flexibility in corals’ association with thermally tolerant symbiont lineages to adapt or acclimatize to future warming oceans should be viewed with conservative optimism as the current rate of environmental changes may outpace the evolutionary capabilities of corals.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Youth-led movements like #FridaysforFuture and the school strikes for climate (henceforth referred to as the climate strikes) are leading calls for action on climate change worldwide. This paper reports on a thematic analysis of protest signs, and interviews with young climate strikers, at a climate strike in Manchester, UK, in 2019. Results This paper explores the ways in which dominant, adult-centred frameworks for conceptualizing young people’s environmental activism tend to obscure the complexities of the climate strike movement. In contrast, this study examines the complex political activism of climate strikers as a ‘subaltern group’, who take political action in a wider context of intersecting categories of oppression and marginalization – including youth as a category of marginalization – and in the historical context of environmental racism, the enduring legacies of colonialism, and global inequality during contemporary capitalism. Conclusions The article develops a theoretical model for future research, based on a model of two constraining frames that limit analysis of the climate strikes in particular and young people’s environmental activism in general. This paper contributes to a step change in methods for the study of this remarkable movement in a global context.",

    "abstract": "Thermokarst lakes and ponds are major elements of permafrost landscapes, occupying up to 40% of the land area in some Arctic regions. Shallow lakes freeze to the bed, thus preventing permafrost thaw underneath them and limiting the length of the period with greenhouse gas production in the unfrozen lake sediments. Radar remote sensing permits to distinguish lakes with bedfast ice due to the difference in backscatter intensities from bedfast and floating ice. This study investigates the potential of a unique time series of three-year repeat-pass TerraSAR-X (TSX) imagery with high temporal (11 days) and spatial (10 m) resolution for monitoring bedfast ice as well as ice phenology of lakes in the zone of continuous permafrost in the Lena River Delta, Siberia. TSX backscatter intensity is shown to be an excellent tool for monitoring floating versus bedfast lake ice as well as ice phenology. TSX-derived timing of ice grounding and the ice growth model CLIMo are used to retrieve the ice thicknesses of the bedfast ice at points where in situ ice thickness measurements were available. Comparison shows good agreement in the year of field measurements. Additionally, for the first time, an 11-day sequential interferometric coherence time series is analyzed as a supplementary approach for the bedfast ice monitoring. The coherence time series detects most of the ice grounding as well as spring snow/ice melt onset. Overall, the results show the great value of TSX time series for monitoring Arctic lake ice and provide a basis for various applications: for instance, derivation of shallow lakes bathymetry, evaluation of winter water resources and locating fish winter habitat as well as estimation of taliks extent in permafrost.",

    "abstract": "Climate variation and change influence several ecosystem components including forest fires. To examine long-term temporal variations of forest fire danger, a fire danger day (FDD) model was developed. Using mean temperature and total precipitation of the Finnish wildfire season (June–August), the model describes the climatological preconditions of fire occurrence and gives the number of fire danger days during the same time period. The performance of the model varied between different regions in Finland being best in south and west. In the study period 1908–2011, the year-to-year variation of FDD was large and no significant increasing or decreasing tendencies could be found. Negative slopes of linear regression lines for FDD could be explained by the simultaneous, mostly not significant increases in precipitation. Years with the largest wildfires did not stand out from the FDD time series. This indicates that intra-seasonal variations of FDD enable occurrence of large-scale fires, despite the whole season's fire danger is on an average level. Based on available monthly climate data, it is possible to estimate the general fire conditions of a summer. However, more detailed input data about weather conditions, land use, prevailing forestry conventions and socio-economical factors would be needed to gain more specific information about a season's fire risk.",

    "abstract": "The transportation sector plays a prominent role in driving the economy of any given nation. However, with the recent tensions arising in and around the transportation sector, sustainable mobility concepts have evolved. However, it is quite unclear whether sustainable mobility is feasible and exhibits economic returns, environmental benefits, and societal advantages. Hence, taking into account the environmental, economic, and social impact, and technical possibilities, this study intends to analyse sustainable mobility in relation to economic returns, environmental benefits and societal advantages using bibliometric analysis. For this study, we considered two decades of research, from 2001 to 2021. An in-depth search was performed on articles generated in the last two decades to assess the state of the literature on sustainable mobility. The most reverent, frequently referenced papers and influential journals in the field of sustainable mobility were identified. The acquired findings highlight the most prominent publications, journals, and authors who have made significant contributions to sustainable mobility studies, as well as the sub-areas or themes linked to sustainable mobility. Overall, the analysis discovered current paradigms, significant research topics, and a relationship between the domains of sustainable mobility studies. Meanwhile, this study also demonstrates advancements in the primary themes and sub-areas during the previous 20 years and alterations in future research fields. In addition, this study identified the promotion of rapid-reliable-safe-convenient (RRSC) transportation services, reduction in urban car traffic, and support to low transportation demand as the critical steps that require immediate attention in order to build a sustainable mobility future. We also observed that hydrogen would be a promising fuel and potential technology for the future mobility sector in the post-COVID era.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As climate change intensifies, the development of resilient rice that can tolerate abiotic stresses is urgently needed. In nature, many wild plants have evolved a variety of mechanisms to protect themselves from environmental stresses. Wild relatives of rice may have abundant and virtually untapped genetic diversity and are an essential source of germplasm for the improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in cultivated rice. Unfortunately, the barriers of traditional breeding approaches, such as backcrossing and transgenesis, make it challenging and complex to transfer the underlying resilience traits between plants. However, de novo domestication via genome editing is a quick approach to produce rice with high yields from orphans or wild relatives. African wild rice, Oryza longistaminata, which is part of the AA-genome Oryza species has two types of propagation strategies viz. vegetative propagation via rhizome and seed propagation. It also shows tolerance to multiple types of abiotic stress, and therefore O. longistaminata is considered a key candidate of wild rice for heat, drought, and salinity tolerance, and it is also resistant to lodging. Importantly, O. longistaminata is perennial and propagates also via rhizomes both of which are traits that are highly valuable for the sustainable production of rice. Therefore, O. longistaminata may be a good candidate for de novo domestication through genome editing to obtain rice that is more climate resilient than modern elite cultivars of O. sativa.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the influence of environmental covariates on plant distribution is critical, especially for aquatic plant species. Climate change is likely to alter the distribution of aquatic species. However, knowledge of this change on the burden of aquatic macroorganisms is often fraught with difficulty. Ottelia, a model genus for studying the evolution of the aquatic family Hydrocharitaceae, is mainly distributed in slow-flowing creeks, rivers, or lakes throughout pantropical regions in the world. Due to recent rapid climate changes, natural Ottelia populations have declined significantly. By modeling the effects of climate change on the distribution of Ottelia species and assessing the degree of niche similarity, we sought to identify high suitability regions and help formulate conservation strategies. The models use known background points to determine how environmental covariates vary spatially and produce continental maps of the distribution of the Ottelia species in Africa. Additionally, we estimated the possible influences of the optimistic and extreme pessimistic representative concentration pathways scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for the 2050s. Our results show that the distinct distribution patterns of studied Ottelia species were influenced by topography (elevation) and climate (e.g., mean temperature of driest quarter, annual precipitation, and precipitation of the driest month). While there is a lack of accord in defining the limiting factors for the distribution of Ottelia species, it is clear that water-temperature conditions have promising effects when kept within optimal ranges. We also note that climate change will impact Ottelia by accelerating fragmentation and habitat loss. The assessment of niche overlap revealed that Ottelia cylindrica and O. verdickii had slightly more similar niches than the other Ottelia species. The present findings identify the need to enhance conservation efforts to safeguard natural Ottelia populations and provide a theoretical basis for the distribution of various Ottelia species in Africa.",

    "abstract": "Along with the concept of improving reforestation efforts in Lebanon, this study aimed to provide a land suitability analysis for forest species in Lebanon while considering the effect of climate change. Herein, the soil evaluation criteria developed by FAO (The Food and Agriculture Organization) for land suitability classification were implemented through the weighted overlay method to produce suitability maps based on natural variables (soil, climate, and topography) influencing the presence of the species on the land. Cedrus libani, Quercus calliprinos, Ceratonia siliqua, Eucalyptus globulus, and Pinus halepensis are the species considered in this study. The results of this study provide useful information to inform reforestation activities in Lebanon, considering the expected climate change projections for medium- (2050) and long-term (2070) periods, according to two different scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and three General Circulation Models: CCSM4, GFDL-CM3, and HadGEM2-ES. The suitability maps showed a generally critical situation for the spatial distribution of forest species under future climate change compared to the current situation (1970–2000). The distribution of thermophilic species, which tolerate high temperatures (over 20 °C), was projected to expand compared to the current situation. In contrast, the expansion of cold-adapted species may be limited by future climate change conditions. It is crucial to consider the expected effects of climate change to better select species for reforestation and, therefore, to maintain forest cover in Lebanon.",

A total of 115 rural farmers constitute the sample size for this study. Descriptive and relevant inferential statistics such as multivariate probit model were used. The perceived effects of climate change in the study area were erosion/flooding, increase in rainfall, scarce of resources, increase in temperature, and increase in pest and disease infestation.
