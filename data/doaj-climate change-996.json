    "abstract": "Introduction: Climate change is causing far-reaching yet underappreciated worsening of outcomes across the mental health and wellbeing spectrum. Despite increasing attention to the mental health impacts of climate change, an absence of a clear, cross-sectoral agenda for action has held back progress against the dual and interconnected challenges of supporting human and planetary health. This study aims to serve as an essential first step to address this gap. Methods: Harnessing the expertise of a diverse panel of 61 participants, representing 24 nationalities, this study developed and prioritized recommendations for action on climate change and mental health across the relevant sectors of research, policy, healthcare and the third sector, and used a Delphi-style methodology to examine their feasibility and importance. Results: Broadly, the prioritized recommendations highlighted the need to expand the evidence base, work collaboratively across sectors, and raise awareness. While broadly there was consensus on recommendation importance, there was greater variation in the reported feasibility of the recommendations, which differed across settings. Other common themes included the need for cultural and resource contextualization, raising awareness of and addressing mental health co-benefits via climate action, and working with communities with lived experience to develop and implement the findings. As there may be some interdependencies between the recommendations, further work needs to identify how best to implement them. Conclusion: The recommendations serve as a robust and evidence-based framework that can be used as a foundation to devise locally appropriate, concrete implementation strategies matching levels of need and resource. These also serve as a clear call to action for investment from leaders across sectors to ensure they are realized.",

    "abstract": "The Yangtze River Basin and Huaihe River Basin in Southern China experienced severe floods 1998 and 2016. The reasons for the flooding hazards include the following two factors: hazardous weather conditions and degradation of the hydrological environment due to anthropogenic activities. This review work investigated the weather conditions based on recorded data, which showed that both 1998 and 2016 were in El Nino periods. Human activities include the degradations of rivers and lakes and the effects caused by the building of the Three Gorges Dam. In addition, the flooding in 2016 had a lower hazard scale than that in 1998 but resulted in larger economic losses than that of 1998. To mitigate urban waterlogging caused by flooding hazards, China proposed a new strategy named Spongy City (SPC) in 2014. SPC promotes sustainable city development so that a city has the resilience to adapt to climate change, to mitigate the impacts of waterlogging caused by extreme rainfall events. The countermeasures used to tackle the SPC construction-related problems, such as local inundation, water resource shortage, storm water usage, and water pollution control, are proposed for city management to improve the environment.",

    "abstract": "In the Anthropocene the world is facing an acceleration of human growth and its impact on nature. The expansionist world order which emerged from Europe since colonial times is reaching multiple limits (environmental, economic, social, political and scientific-technical), increasing marginal costs and risks which trigger multiple crises, conflicts and catastrophes that challenge this world order. Alternative futures range from a collapse of human civilization to geopolitical power competition and conflict between rivals to disruptive technical innovations and systemic transformation of the economy and society within natural boundaries. In response to geopolitical conflicts and their consequences, such as climate change and the Russia-Ukraine war, efforts of cooperative governance can help to mitigate, adapt to and manage complex crisis landscapes. Instead of an epochal turn (Zeitenwende) for arms race and war, more promising are sustainable climate protection and a peaceful energy transition within planetary boundaries. To further prevent escalating and mutually enforcing crisis dynamics and geopolitical conflicts in the Anthropocene, cooperative governance needs to adjust to the world's complexity and move from a negative nexus of problems to a positive nexus of solutions. The interaction between geopolitics and governance and the transition from risk cascades to synergies is discussed for the energy-security nexus and the climate-conflict-migration nexus. Energy conflicts can be contained by diminishing land competition and biodiversity loss, as well as risky dependencies on strategic raw materials and conflict minerals. Measures for a sustainable energy transition include energy efficiency and conservation, renewable energy and decarbonization, a circular economy and nature-based solutions. To prevent risk multiplication in the climate-conflict-migration nexus, synergies in climate, migration and security policy facilitate integrative solutions for a socio-ecological transformation based on mitigation and adaptation, conflict resolution and environmental peacebuilding, aiming for a mutual enforcement of sustainability and peace.",

    "abstract": "The most important task for the sustainable development of modern agriculture is to increase the biological diversity of cultivated crops. In recent years, due to global climate change, the possibilities of using more thermophilic crops in new agro-ecological zones have expanded. The problem of increasing the biological diversity of vegetable products largely depends on the introduction of non-traditional plant species, with a simultaneous assessment of the initial material for its use in economically useful purposes and the creation of varieties and hybrids adapted to local conditions. In this regard, Nigella L. is of great interest among rare plant species. It is one of the most famous spicy-aromatic crops in the Mediterranean and Central Asia, possessing a wide range of biologically active compounds and unique medicinal properties. The review article provides information on the origin, biological characteristics and breeding of the culture. A brief review of food, medicinal and other economically useful properties is given, as well as the main elements of the technology for growing nigella are considered. It is shown that the cultivation of this culture will provide an opportunity to expand the range of non-traditional plants and be a promising renewable source of valuable plant raw materials, which will find application in various fields: in agriculture, in the food, pharmaceutical, perfumery and cosmetic industries, as well as in ornamental gardening.",

    "abstract": "The practice of cultivating crops in a controlled environment using a soilless culture method is seeing an increasing level of popularity. The aforementioned challenges include addressing climate change, combating pests and diseases, mitigating falling soil fertility, and ensuring constant production and quality. One of the potential crops that could be grown with such a method is soybean. Soybean cultivation in a controlled environment using soilless culture still needs more information, especially regarding nutrient solution management of certain soybean varieties. Thus, this study investigated the impact of nutrient concentrations and variety on soybean growth, yield, and chemical composition. This research was carried out in a plant growth chamber using expanded clay aggregate as a soilless substrate. The treatments were four nutrient concentrations: 0% (control), 50%, 100%, and 150%, and two different varieties: Martina and Johanna. The findings of this research revealed that there were significant differences in nutrient treatments on all parameters measured. Application of nutrient concentration at 50% resulted in the most profound root size for both varieties. Applying 100% nutrient concentration produced a higher 100-grain weight for the Johanna variety. Application of nutrient concentration at 150% resulted in the highest shoot weight and shoot:root ratio for both varieties, with varietal differences. Furthermore, applying nutrient concentration at 150% also produced the highest grain yield/pot, protein yield, and lipid yield for both varieties. Thus, the nutrient concentration between 100% and 150% gave a positive effect and can be applied for planting Martina and Johanna using this system.",

    "abstract": "The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami significantly impacted the coastal shoreline of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, causing widespread destruction of infrastructure and ecological damage. This study aims to analyze the short- and long-term shoreline changes in South Andaman, focusing on 2004–2005 (pre- and post-tsunami) and 1990–2023 (to assess periodic changes). Using remote sensing techniques and geospatial tools such as the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), shoreline change rates were calculated in four zones, revealing the extent of the tsunami’s impact. During the pre- and post-tsunami periods, the maximum coastal erosion rate was −410.55 m/year, while the maximum accretion was 359.07 m/year in zone A, the island’s east side. For the 1990–2023 period, the most significant coastal shoreline erosion rate was also recorded in zone A, which was recorded at −2.3 m/year. After analyzing the result, it can be seen that the tsunami severely affected the island’s east side. To validate the coastal shoreline measurements, the root mean square error (RMSE) of Landsat-7 and Google Earth was 18.53 m, enabling comparisons of the accuracy of different models on the same dataset. The results demonstrate the extensive impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami on South Andaman’s coastal shoreline and the value of analyzing shoreline changes to understand the short- and long-term consequences of such events on coastal ecosystems. This information can inform conservation efforts, management strategies, and disaster response plans to mitigate future damage and allocate resources more efficiently. By better understanding the impact of tsunamis on coastal shorelines, emergency responders, government agencies, and conservationists can develop more effective strategies to protect these fragile ecosystems and the communities that rely on them.",

    "abstract": "In the future, Indonesia will become increasingly dependent on dryland agriculture. New adaptive technology innovations able to transform drylands into arable land throughout almost the entire year have been developed to anticipate global climate change in tropical areas. This article reviews the results of research on the importance of climate and water management technology to increase the crop index and productivity in Indonesia. We found that irrigation treatment at 80% of the FAO-recommended rate resulted in the highest maize stover yield (around 13.65–14.10 t h−1). Irrigation treatment at 60% of the FAO-recommended rate for soybeans (at 0.24 L s−1 h−1) produced good-quality soybean seeds. The use of existing water resources can increase the planted area from 1.25 to 1.67 and increase the cropping index during the second planting season in the same area. Agricultural systems based on water management can improve their crop index and productivity, and anticipate climate change to increase farmers’ incomes and wellbeing. Support measures in the form of regulations, legislation, acts, programmes, and policies from central and local governments for land use and management are crucial. The development of infrastructure by establishing water management institutions at the village/farmers’ group levels to allocate irrigation water is a leverage point to develop dryland agricultural systems appropriately and judiciously to assist in sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "The environment and the health of mankind are subject to strong pressures from pollutants. The ambition of a better quality of life is often frustrated by the increase in emissions as a result of the increasing consumption of resources and energy to satisfy the growth of the world’s population and its expectations for socioeconomic development. At times, problems take on a planetary dimension, the best known example being greenhouse gas emission, with the resulting effects of climate change. Pollution highlights our failure to provide adequate education, which is essential if we are to become fully aware of problems and actively seek sustainable solutions. To this end, it is essential to set up an extended environmental and health education program in all communities that will accompany younger generations from the beginning of their education in order to make them conscious players in protecting the environment and their own health. The size of the problems requires that a joint effort be made at an international level in the political realm and in the scientific-cultural realm in order to share experiences and sensitivity and to seek joint solutions. It is necessary to assign an increasingly important role to scientific and technological innovation which, in the last century, from Marconi to Einstein to Fleming, to the most recent innovations in the fields of genomics and microchips, has allowed humanity to achieve a rate of growth of wellbeing never previously seen in its thousands of years of history. This innovation must rationally be entrusted with our expectations to provide a practical solution to the problems of pollution that threaten our everyday lives and the survival of the planet. This text discusses the types of progress most eagerly awaited in the fields of water supply, wastewater treatment, atmospheric pollution and waste disposal.",
